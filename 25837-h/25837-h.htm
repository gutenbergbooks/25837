<h2>I</h2>
</div>

<p>Billy Deering let himself into his
father&#8217;s house near Radford Hills,
Westchester County, and with a nod to
Briggs, who came into the hall to take
his hat and coat, began turning over
the letters that lay on the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hood has arrived, sir,&#8221; the
servant announced. &#8220;I put him in
the south guest-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering lifted his head with a jerk.
&#8220;Hood&mdash;what Hood?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hood is all I know, sir. He
said he was expected&mdash;you had asked
him for the night. If there&#8217;s a mistake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering reached for his hat and
coat, which Briggs still held. His face
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
whitened, and the outstretched hand
shook visibly. Briggs eyed him with
grave concern, then took a step toward
the stairway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish, sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Briggs,&#8221; Deering
snapped. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;d forgotten
I had a guest coming; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He opened a letter with assumed carelessness
and held it before his eyes until
the door closed upon Briggs. Then his
jaws tightened. He struck his hands
together and mounted the steps doggedly,
as though prepared for a disagreeable
encounter.
</p>
<p>All the way out on the train he had
feared that this might happen. The
long arm of the law was already clutching
at his collar, but he had not reckoned
with this quick retribution. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
presence of the unknown man in the
house could be explained on no other
hypothesis than the discovery of his
theft of two hundred thousand dollars
in gilt-edged bonds from the banking-house
of Deering, Gaylord &amp; Co. It
only remained for him to kill himself
and escape from the shame that would
follow exposure. He must do this at
once, but first he would see who had
been sent to apprehend him. Hood
was an unfamiliar name; he had never
known a Hood anywhere, he was confident
of that.
</p>
<p>The house was ominously quiet.
Deering paused when he reached his
own room, glanced down the hall, then
opened the door softly, and fell back
with a gasp before the blaze of lights.
There, lost in the recesses of a comfortable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
chair, with his legs thrown
across the mahogany table, sat a man
he had never seen before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Deering; very glad you&#8217;ve
come,&#8221; murmured the stranger, glancing
up unhurriedly from his perusal of
a newspaper.
</p>
<p>He had evidently been reading for
some time, as the floor was littered with
papers. At this instant something in
the page before him caught his attention
and he deftly extracted a quarter
of a column of text, pinched it with the
scissors&#8217; points and dropped it on a
pile of similar cuttings on the edge of
the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment!&#8221; he remarked in
the tone of a man tolerant of interruptions,
&#8220;and do pardon me for mussing
up your room. I liked it better here
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
than in the pink room your man gave
me&mdash;no place there to put your legs!
Creature of habit; can&#8217;t rest without
sticking my feet up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He opened a fresh newspaper and ran
his eyes over the first page with the
trained glance of an expert exchange
reader.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Minneapolis papers are usually
worthless for my purposes, and yet
occasionally they print something I
wouldn&#8217;t miss. I&#8217;m the best friend the
&#8216;buy your home paper&#8217; man has,&#8221; he
ran on musingly, skimming the page
and ignoring Deering, who continued to
stare in stupefied amazement from the
doorway. &#8220;Ah!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The scissors flashed and the unknown
added another item to his collection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; he remarked with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
sigh. He dropped his feet to the floor,
rose, and lazily stretched himself.
</p>
<p>Tall, compactly built, a face weather-beaten
where the flesh showed above a
close-clipped brownish beard, and hair,
slightly gray, brushed back smoothly
from a broad forehead&mdash;these items
Deering noted swiftly as he dragged
himself across the threshold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, a day like this would put
soul into a gargoyle,&#8221; the stranger remarked,
brushing the paper-shavings
from his trousers. &#8220;Motored up from
Jersey and had a grand time all the way.
I walk, mostly, but commandeer a machine
for long skips. To learn how to
live, my dear boy, that&#8217;s the great business!
Not sure I&#8217;ve caught the trick,
but I&#8217;m working at it, with such feeble
talents as the gods have bestowed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>He filled a pipe deftly from a canvas
bag, and drew the strings together with
white, even teeth.
</p>
<p>This cool, lounging stranger was playing
a trick of some kind; Deering was
confident of this and furious at his utter
inability to cope with him. He clung
to the back of a chair, trembling with
anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name,&#8221; the visitor continued,
tossing his match into an ash-tray, &#8220;is
Hood&mdash;R. Hood. The lone initial might
suggest Robert or Roderigo, but if your
nursery library was properly stocked you
will recall a gentleman named Robin
Hood of Sherwood Forest. I don&#8217;t
pretend to be a descendant&mdash;far from
it; adopted the name out of sheer admiration
for one of the grandest figures
in all literature. Robin Hood, Don
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Quixote, and George Borrow are rubricated
saints in my calendar. By the
expression on your face I see that you
don&#8217;t make me out, and I can&#8217;t blame
you for thinking me insane; but, my
dear boy, such an assumption does me
a cruel wrong. Briefly, I&#8217;m a hobo with
a weakness for good society, and yet a
friend of the under dog. I confess to a
passion for grand opera and lobster in
all its forms. Do you grasp the idea?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering did not grasp it. The man
had protested his sanity, but Deering
had heard somewhere that a confident
belief in their mental soundness is a
common hallucination of lunatics. Still,
the stranger&#8217;s steady gray eyes did not
encourage the suspicion that he was
mad. Deering&#8217;s own reason, already
severely taxed, was unequal to the task
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
of dealing with this assured and cheerful
Hood, who looked like a gentleman
but talked like a fool.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, who are you and
what do you want?&#8221; he demanded angrily.
</p>
<p>Hood pushed him gently into a chair,
utterly ignoring his fury.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What time do we dine? Seven-thirty,
I think your servant told me.
I shan&#8217;t dress if you don&#8217;t mind. Speaking
of clothes, that man of yours is a
very superficial observer; let me in on
the strength of my automobile coat, and
I suppose the machine impressed him
too. If he&#8217;d looked under the surface
at these poor rags, I&#8217;d never have got
by! That illustrates an ancient habit
of the serving class in thinking all is
gold that glitters. Snobs! Deplorable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
weakness! Let&#8217;s talk like sensible men
till the gong sounds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering shook himself impatiently.
This absurd talk, carefully calculated,
he assumed, to prolong his misery, had
torn his nerves to shreds. Hood sat
down close to him in a straight-backed
chair, crossed his legs, and thrust his
hands into his coat pockets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy, in the name of all the
gods at once, cheer up! To satisfy your
very natural curiosity, I&#8217;ll say that I
fancied you were in trouble and needed
a strong arm to sustain you in your
hour of trial. Laudable purpose&mdash;ah,
I see you begin to feel more comfortable.
I have every intention of playing
the big brother to you for a few
hours, weeks, or months, or till you come
out of your green funk. You wonder,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
of course, what motive I have for intruding
in this way&mdash;lying to your servant,
and making myself at home in your
house. The motive, so far as there is
any, is the purely selfish one of finding
enjoyment for myself, while incidentally
being of service to you. And you&#8217;re
bound to admit that that&#8217;s a fair offer
in this world of greed and selfishness.
The great trouble with most of us is
that the flavor so soon wears out of the
chewing-gum. Do you remember the
last time you had a good, hearty laugh?
I&#8217;ll wager you don&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering scowled, but Hood continued
to expound his philosophy:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The world&#8217;s roaring along at such a
rate we can&#8217;t find happiness anywhere
but in the dictionary. It&#8217;s worrying me
to death, just the spectacle of the fool
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
old human race never getting a chance
to sit down by the side of the road and
pick the pebbles out of its shoes. Everybody&#8217;s
feet hurt and everybody&#8217;s carrying
a blood pressure that&#8217;s bound to
blow the roof off. I tell you, Deering,
civilization hasn&#8217;t got anything on the
gypsies but soap and sanitary plumbing,
I&#8217;m just forty-five and for years I&#8217;ve
kept in motion most of the time. Alone
of great travellers William Jennings
Bryan has reviewed more water-tanks
than I. I find the same delight in Butte,
Peoria, Galesburg, Des Moines, Ashtabula,
and Bangor, in Tallahassee, Birmingham,
and Waco, that others seek in
London, Paris, and Vienna&mdash;and it&#8217;s
all American stuff&mdash;business of flags flying
and Constitution being chanted offstage
by a choir of a million voices!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
I&#8217;ve lived in coal-camps in Colorado, wintered
with Maine lumbermen, hopped
the ties with hobos, and enjoyed the
friendship of thieves. I don&#8217;t mean to
brag, but I suppose there isn&#8217;t a really
first-rate crook in the country that I
don&#8217;t know. And down in the underworld
they look on me&mdash;if I may modestly
say it&mdash;as an old reliable friend.
I&#8217;ve found these contacts immensely
instructive, as you may imagine. Don&#8217;t
get nervous! I never stole anything in
my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thrust his fingers into his inside
waistcoat pocket, and drew out a packet
of bills, neatly folded, and opened them
for Deering&#8217;s wondering inspection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg of you don&#8217;t jump to the conclusion
that I roll in wealth. Money is
poison to me; I hate the very smell of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
it&mdash;haven&#8217;t a cent of my own in the
world. This belongs to my chauffeur&mdash;carry
it as a precaution merely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hood relighted his pipe, and dreamily
watched the match blacken and curl in
his fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your chauffeur?&#8221; Deering suggested,
like a child prompting a parent
in the midst of an absorbing story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Cassowary&#8221;&mdash;he pronounced
the word lingeringly as though
to prolong his pleasure in it&mdash;&#8220;real name
doesn&#8217;t matter. His father rolled up a
big wad cutting the forest primeval into
lumber, and left it to Cassowary&mdash;matter
of a million or two. Cassowary had
been driven to drink by an unhappy
love-affair when I plucked him as a
brand from burning Broadway. Nice
chap, but too much self-indulgence;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
never had any discipline. He&#8217;s pretty
well broken in now, and as we seemed
to need each other we follow the long
trail together. Manage to hit it off
first-rate. He&#8217;s still mooning over the
girl; tough that he can&#8217;t have the only
thing in the world he wants! Obstreperous
parent adumbrated in the foreground,
shotgun in hand. I don&#8217;t allow
Cassowary to carry any money&mdash;would
rather risk contamination myself than
expose him to it. If he stays with me
for a few years, his accumulated income
will roll up so that he can endow
orchestras and art museums all
through the prairie towns of the West,
and become a great benefactor of mankind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hood&#8217;s story was manifestly absurd,
and yet he invested it with a certain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
plausibility. Even Cassowary, as Hood
described him, seemed a wholly credible
person, and the bills Hood had drawn
from his pocket bore all the marks of
honest money.
</p>
<p>Dinner was announced, and Hood
lounged down-stairs and into the dining-room
arm in arm with Deering. A
tapestry on the wall immediately attracted
his attention. After pecking at
the edges with his long, slender fingers
he turned to his seat with a sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Preposterous imitation! I dare say
it was passed off as a real Gobelin, but
I know the artist who fakes those things&mdash;a
New Jersey genius and very smooth
at the game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering had never paid the slightest
attention to the tapestry, which had
hung in the room for a dozen years,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
but he apologized in a vein of irony
for its spuriousness, and steeled himself
against complaints of the food; but
after tasting the soup Hood praised it
with enthusiasm. He was wholly at
ease, and his table manners were beyond
criticism. He seemed indifferent
to the construction Deering or the bewildered
Briggs might place upon his
confessions, to which he now glibly addressed
himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A couple of years ago I was roaming
through the Western provinces with a
couple of old friends who persist&mdash;against
my advice, I assure you&mdash;in the
childish pastime of safe-blowing. We
got pinched <i>en bloc</i>, and as I was broke
I had to sponge on the yeggs to get me
out of jail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Briggs dropped a plate and Deering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
frowned at the interruption. Hood went
on tranquilly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;However, I was immured only three
weeks, and the experience was broadening.
That was in Omaha, and I&#8217;ll
say without fear of contradiction that
the Omaha jail is one of the most comfortable
in the Missouri Valley. I recommend
it, Deering, without reservation,
to any one in search of tranquillity.
After they turned me loose I introduced
myself to an old college classmate&mdash;fraternity
brother&mdash;no danger of exposure.
I had him put me up at the Omaha
Club, and then I gave a dinner to the
United States commissioner who heard
my case, the district attorney, and the
United States marshal. I wanted to
ask the yeggs too&mdash;it seemed only square&mdash;but
the judge was out of town, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
the marshal was afraid his Honor might
cite him for contempt if he brought his
prisoners to my party. These things
probably seem to you most banal, but
take it all round I do manage to keep
amused. Of course, now and then I
pay more for my fun than it&#8217;s worth.
Last summer I mixed in with some
moonshiners in Tennessee. Moonshining
is almost a lost art, and I wanted the
experience before the business became
extinct. An unsociable lot, the lone still
boys, and wouldn&#8217;t warm up to me a
bit. The unhappy result was a bullet
through my left lung. I got patched up
by a country doctor, but had to spend
two months in a Philadelphia hospital
for the finishing touches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering&#8217;s uneasiness increased. This
man who spoke so blithely of imprisonment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
and bullets in his lung must have
a motive for his visit. With a jerk of
the head he sent Briggs from the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all very amusing,&#8221; he remarked
with decision as he put down his
salad-fork, &#8220;but will you pardon me for
asking just why you came here? I
have your own word for it that your
favorite amusement is consorting with
criminals, and that money you flashed
may have been stolen for all I know! If
you have any business with me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy, I don&#8217;t blame you
for growing restless,&#8221; replied Hood amiably.
&#8220;Of course, I know that your father
and sister are away, and that you
are alone. Your family history I am
pretty familiar with; your antecedents
and connections are excellent. Your
mother, who died four years ago, was of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
the Rhode Island Ranger family&mdash;and
there is no better blood in America.
Your sister Constance won the Westchester
golf championship last year&mdash;I
learned that from the newspapers, which
I read with a certain passion, as you
have observed. If I hadn&#8217;t thought you
needed company&mdash;my company particularly&mdash;I
shouldn&#8217;t have landed on your
door-step. You dined Monday night at
the Hotel Pendragon&mdash;at a table in
the corner on the Fifth Avenue side,
and your dejection touched me deeply.
Afterward you went down to the rathskeller,
and sat there all alone drinking
stuff you didn&#8217;t need. It roused my apprehensions.
I feared things were going
badly with you, and I thought I&#8217;d give
you a chance to unburden your soul to
me, Hood, the enchanted hobo&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For sheer cheek&mdash;&#8221; began Deering
hotly.
</p>
<p>Hood lifted his hand deprecatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t!&#8221; he remarked soothingly.
&#8220;With the tinkle of a bell you
can call your man and have me bounced.
I repacked my bag after taking a bath
in your very comfortable guest-room,
and we can part immediately. But let
us be sensible, Deering; just between
ourselves, don&#8217;t you really need me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His tone was ingratiating, his manner
the kindest. Deering had walked the
streets for two days trying to bring
himself to the point of confessing his
plight to one of a score of loyal friends&mdash;men
he had known from prep-school
days, and on through college: active,
resourceful, wealthy young fellows who
would risk much to help him&mdash;and yet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
in his fear and misery he had shrunk
from approaching them. Hood, he was
now convinced, was not a detective come
to arrest him; in fact his guest&#8217;s sympathies
and connections seemed to lie
on the other side of the law&#8217;s barricade.
</p>
<p>They had coffee in the living-room,
where Hood, inspired by specimens of
the work of several of the later French
painters, discussed art with sophistication.
Deering observed him intently.
There was something immensely attractive
in Hood&#8217;s face; his profile, clean-cut
as a cameo, was thoroughly masculine;
his head was finely moulded, and his
gray eyes were frank and responsive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible,&#8221; said Deering, after
a long silence in which Hood smoked
meditatively, &#8220;that you may be able to
help me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>On a sudden impulse he rose and put
out his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Hood gravely,
&#8220;but don&#8217;t tell me unless you really
want to.&#8221;
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
<h2>II</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;So after all the bother of stealing
two hundred thousand dollars&#8217;
worth of negotiable securities you <i>lost</i>
them!&#8221; Hood remarked when Deering
ended his recital.
</p>
<p>Deering frowned and nodded. Not
only had he told his story to this utter
stranger, but he had found infinite relief
in doing so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go over the points again,&#8221;
said Hood calmly. &#8220;You set down your
suitcase containing two hundred K. &amp;
L. Terminal 5&#8217;s in the Grand Central
Station, turned round to buy a ticket
to Boston, and when you picked up the
bag it was the wrong one! Such instances
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
are not rare; the strong family
resemblance between suitcases has
caused much trouble in this world. Only
the other day a literary friend told me
the magazine editors have placed a ban
on mixed suitcases as a fictional device;
but of course that doesn&#8217;t help us any
in this affair. I&#8217;ve known a few professional
suitcase lifters. One of the
smoothest is Sammy Tibbots, but he&#8217;s
doing time in Joliet, so we may as well
eliminate Sammy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; Deering exclaimed impatiently.
&#8220;It was a girl who did the
trick! She was at the local ticket window,
just behind me. You see, I was
nervous and after I bought my ticket it
dropped to the floor, and while I was
picking it up that girl grabbed my suitcase
and beat it for the gate.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Enter the girl,&#8221; Hood muttered.
&#8220;&#8217;Twas ever thus! Of course, you telegraphed
ahead and stopped her&mdash;that
was the obvious course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go! If I&#8217;d done that,
there wouldn&#8217;t have been any publicity;
oh, no!&#8221; Deering replied contemptuously.
&#8220;People don&#8217;t carry big
bunches of bonds around in suitcases;
they send &#8217;em by registered express.
Of course, if the girl was honest she&#8217;d
report the matter to the railroad officials
and they&#8217;d notify the police, and they&#8217;d
be looking for the thief! And that&#8217;s
just what I don&#8217;t want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; Hood assented
readily. &#8220;That was Wednesday and
this is Friday, and you haven&#8217;t seen
any ads in the papers about a suitcase
full of bonds? Well, I&#8217;d hardly have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
missed such a thing myself. What did
the girl look like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Small, dressed in blue and wearing
a white veil. She made a lively sprint
for the gate, and climbed into the last
car just as the train started. The conductor
yelled to her not to try it, but
the porter jumped out and pushed her
up the steps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At Hood&#8217;s suggestion Deering brought
the suitcase that had been exchanged
for his own, and disclosed its contents&mdash;a
filmy night-dress, a silk shirt-waist,
a case of ivory toilet articles bearing a
complicated monogram, a bottle of
violet-water, half empty, a pair of silk
stockings, a novel, a pair of patent-leather
pumps, all tumbled together.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_2' id='linki_2'></a>
<img src='images/illus-030.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;The young person left in haste, that&#8217;s clear enough,&#8221;<br />
remarked Hood.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The young person left in haste,
that&#8217;s clear enough,&#8221; remarked Hood, balancing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
one of the pumps in his hand.
&#8220;&#8216;Bonet, Paris,&#8217;&#8221; he read, squinting at
the lining. &#8220;Most deplorable that we
have both slippers; one would have
been a clew, and we could have spent
the rest of our lives measuring footprints.
Very nice slippers, though;
fastidious young person, I&#8217;ll wager. The
monogram on these trinkets is of no
assistance&mdash;it might be R. G. T., or T.
G. R., or G. R. T. Monograms are a
nuisance, a delusion, a snare!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering flung the faintly scented
violet-tinted toilet-case into the bag resentfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The silly little fool; why didn&#8217;t she
mind what she was doing!&#8221; he exclaimed
angrily, &#8220;and not steal other
people&#8217;s things!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; Hood remonstrated,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
&#8220;but from your story the less you speak
of stealing the better. But it isn&#8217;t clear
yet why you sneaked the bonds. Your
father has a reputation for generosity;
you&#8217;re an only son and slated to succeed
him in the banking-house. Just
what was your idea in starting for Boston
with the loot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was to help Ned Ranscomb, an
old pal of mine,&#8221; Deering blurted&mdash;&#8220;one
of the best fellows on earth, who
has pulled me out of a lot of holes. He&#8217;d
taken options on Mizpah Copper for
more than he could pay for and fell
on my neck to help him out. And the
rotten part of it is that I can&#8217;t find him
anywhere! I&#8217;ve telephoned and telegraphed
all over creation, but he&#8217;s fallen
off the earth! I tell you everything
from the start has gone wrong. I guess
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
I didn&#8217;t tell you that I already had a
couple of hundred thousand in Mizpah&mdash;all
I could put up personally, and
now I&#8217;ve lost the two hundred thousand
I stole, and Ned&#8217;s got cold feet and
drowned himself, and here I&#8217;m talking
about it to a man who may be a crook
for all I know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This disappearance of Ranscomb has
a suspicious look,&#8221; remarked Hood, ignoring
the fling. &#8220;Either money or a
woman, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ranscomb,&#8221; Deering retorted savagely,
&#8220;is all business and never fools
with women. And you can bet that
with this big copper deal on he wouldn&#8217;t
waste time on any girl that ever was
born.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Human beings are as we find them,&#8221;
observed Hood judicially, &#8220;but you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
entirely too tragic about this whole
business. If it isn&#8217;t comedy, it&#8217;s nothing.
I&#8217;ll wager the girl who skipped
with your stolen boodle has a sense of
humor. The key-note to her character
is in this novel she grabbed as she
hastily packed her bag&mdash;&#8216;The Madness
of May.&#8217; That&#8217;s one of the drollest
books ever written. A story like that is
a boon to mankind; it kept me chuckling
all night. Haven&#8217;t read it? Well,
the heroine excused herself from a dinner-table
that was boring her to death,
ran to her room and packed a suitcase,
and that was the last her friends saw of
her for some time. Along about this
season it&#8217;s in the blood of healthy human
beings to pine for clean air and the open
road. It&#8217;s the wanderlust that&#8217;s in all
of us, old and young alike. It&#8217;s possible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
that the young lady who ran off with
your bonds felt the spring madness and
determined to hit the trail as the girl did
in that yarn. Finding herself possessed
of a lot of bonds belonging to a stranger,
I dare say she is badly frightened. Put
yourself in that girl&#8217;s place, Deering&mdash;imagine
her feelings, landing somewhere
after a hurried journey, opening her
suitcase to chalk her nose, and finding
herself a thief!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rot!&#8221; sniffed Deering angrily.
</p>
<p>One moment he distrusted Hood; the
next his heart warmed to him. At the
table the light-hearted adventurer had
kept him entertained and amused with
his running comment on books, public
characters, the world&#8217;s gold supply, and
scrapes he had been in, without dropping
any clew to his identity. He seemed to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
be a veritable encyclopædia of places;
apparently there was not a town in the
United States that he hadn&#8217;t visited,
and he spoke of exclusive clubs and
thieves&#8217; dens in the same breath. But
Deering&#8217;s hopes of gaining practical aid
in the search for the lost bonds was
rapidly waning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use being silly about
this; I&#8217;m going to telephone to a detective
agency and tell them to send out
a good man, right away&mdash;to-night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; Hood assented, &#8220;but
if you do, you&#8217;ll regret it to your last
hour. I know the whole breed, and you
may count on their making a mess of
it. And consider for a moment that
what you propose means putting a hired
bloodhound on the trail of a girl who
probably never harmed a kitten in her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
life. It would be rotten caddishness to
send a policeman after her. It isn&#8217;t
done, Deering; it isn&#8217;t done! Of course,
there&#8217;s not much chance that the sleuths
would ever come within a hundred miles
of her, but what if they found her! You
are a gentleman, Deering, and that&#8217;s not
the game for you to play.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell me a better one! In ten
days at the farthest father will be back
and what am I going to say to him&mdash;how
am I going to explain breaking
into his safety box and stealing those
bonds?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t explain it, of course, and
it&#8217;s rather up to you, son, to put &#8217;em
back. Every hour you spend talking
about it is wasted time. That girl&#8217;s
had your suitcase two days, and it&#8217;s
your duty to find her. Something must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
have happened or she&#8217;d have turned it
back to the railroad company. Perhaps
she&#8217;s been arrested as a thief and
thrown into jail! Again, her few effects
point to a degree of prosperity&mdash;she&#8217;s
not a girl who would steal for profit; I&#8217;ll
swear to that. We must find that girl!
We&#8217;ll toss a slipper and start off the
way the toe points.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Indifferent to Deering&#8217;s snort of disgust,
Hood was already whirling the
slipper in the air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Slightly northeast! There you are,
Deering&mdash;the clear pointing of Fate!
The girl wasn&#8217;t going far or she wouldn&#8217;t
have been in the local ticket line, and
even a lady in haste packs more stuff
for a long journey. We&#8217;ll run up to
the Barton Arms&mdash;an excellent inn, and
establish headquarters. The girl who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
danced off with your two hundred thousand
is probably around there somewhere,
bringing up her tennis for the
first tournaments of the season. Let&#8217;s
be moving; a breath of air will do you
good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all you can do about it, is
it?&#8221; demanded Deering. &#8220;Let me tell
my whole story&mdash;put myself in your
power, and now the best you can do is
to flip a slipper to see which way to
start!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as good a way as any,&#8221; remarked
Hood amiably.
</p>
<p>He pressed the button, ordered his
car, and then led the way back to Deering&#8217;s
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw some things into a bag.
You&#8217;ll soon forget your sordid money
affairs and begin to live, and you&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
better be prepared for anything that
turns up. I&#8217;ll fold the coats; some old
fishing-togs for rough work and jails, and
even your dress suit may come in handy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He fell to work, folding the suits
neatly, while Deering moved about like
a man in a trance, assembling linen and
toilet articles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something tells me we&#8217;re going to
have a pretty good time,&#8221; continued
Hood musingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you untold
kingdoms, things that never were on
sea or land. We shall meet people worn
with the world-old struggle for things
they don&#8217;t need, and who are out in the
tender May air looking for happiness&mdash;the
only business, my dear boy, that&#8217;s
really worth while. And you&#8217;ll be surprised,
son, to find how many such
people there are.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re ready, Cassowary!&#8221; remarked
Hood as they stepped out of
the side door where a big touring-car
was drawn up in the driveway. &#8220;Just
a moment till I get my stick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Briggs had placed their bags in the
car, and Deering had a moment in which
to observe the chauffeur, who stood erect
and touched his cap. Hood&#8217;s protégé
proved to be a tall, dark, well-knit young
fellow dressed in a well-fitting chauffeur&#8217;s
costume.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good night for a run,&#8221; Deering
suggested, eying the man in the light
from the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the people in the house took
good care of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was nothing in Cassowary&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
voice or manner to indicate that he was
the possessor of the fortune to which
Hood had referred so lightly. Deering&#8217;s
hastily formed impressions of Hood&#8217;s
chauffeur were wholly agreeable and satisfying.
</p>
<p>Hood, lingering in the hall, could be
heard warning Briggs against the further
accumulation of fat. He recommended
a new system of reducing, and gave the
flushed and stuttering butler the name of
a New York specialist in dietetics whom
he advised him to consult without delay.
</p>
<p>The chauffeur&#8217;s lips twitched and,
catching Deering&#8217;s eye, he winked. Deering
tapped his forehead. Cassowary
shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it!&#8221; he ejaculated
with spirit.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>At this moment Hood appeared on the
steps, banging his recovered stick noisily
as he descended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Barton Arms, Cassowary,&#8221; he
ordered, and they set off at a lively clip.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>III</h2>
</div>

<p>On the steps of the Barton Arms an
hour later Hood and Deering ran
into two men who were just leaving the
inn. Hood greeted them heartily as old
acquaintances and remained talking to
them while Deering went to ask for
rooms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The suspicions of those fellows always
tickle me,&#8221; he remarked as he
joined Deering at the desk, where he
scrawled &#8220;R. Hood, Sherwoodville,&#8221; on
the register. &#8220;Detectives&mdash;rather good
as the breed goes, but not men of true
vision. Now and then I&#8217;ve been able
to give them a useful hint&mdash;the slightest,
mind you, and only where I could divert
suspicion from some of my friends in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
the underworld. I always try to be of
assistance to predatory genius; there are
clever crooks and stupid ones; the kind
who stoop to vulgar gun-work when their
own stupidity gets them into a tight
pinch don&#8217;t appeal to me. My artistic
sensibilities are affronted by clumsy
work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;&#8221; Deering suggested with
a hasty glance at the door&mdash;&#8220;maybe
they&#8217;re looking for me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, no,&#8221; Hood replied as
they followed a boy with their bags;
&#8220;nothing so intelligent as that. On
the contrary&#8221;&mdash;he paused at the landing
and laid his hand impressively on Deering&#8217;s
arm&mdash;&#8220;on the contrary, they&#8217;re
looking for <i>me</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went on with a chuckle and a
shake of the head, as though the thought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
of being pursued by detectives gave him
the keenest pleasure. When he reached
their rooms he sat down and struck his
knee sharply and chuckled again. Deering
turned frowningly for an explanation
of his mirth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t bother about those chaps!
I repeat, that they are looking for me,
but&#8221;&mdash;he knit his fingers behind his
head and grinned&mdash;&#8220;they don&#8217;t <i>know</i>
it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know you are you!&#8221; exclaimed
Deering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never said a truer word! More
than that, they&#8217;re not likely to! There
are things, son, I&mdash;Hood, the frankest
of mortals&mdash;can&#8217;t tell even you! I,
Hood, the inexplicable; Hood, the prince
of tramps, the connoisseur in all the
arts&mdash;even I must have my secrets;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
but in time, my dear boy, in time you
shall know everything! But there&#8217;s work
before us! The long arm of coincidence
beckons us. We shall test for ourselves
all the claptrap of the highest-priced
novelists.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering walked to the window and
stared out at the landscape, then strode
toward Hood angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like this!&#8221; he wailed despairingly.
&#8220;You promised to help me find
those stolen bonds, and now you&#8217;re
talking like a lunatic again. If I can&#8217;t
find the bonds, I&#8217;ve got to find Ranscomb,
and get back that first two hundred
thousand I gave him. I can&#8217;t
stand this&mdash;detectives waiting for us
wherever we stop, and you babbling
rot&mdash;rot&mdash;&#8221; Words failed him; he
clinched his hands and glared.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bluster, son, or I shall grow
peevish,&#8221; Hood replied tolerantly. &#8220;At
the present moment I feel like taking a
walk under the mystical May stars.
The night invites the soul to meditation;
the stars may have the answer
to all our perplexities. Stop fretting
about your bonds and your friend Ranscomb;
very likely he&#8217;s busted, clean
broke; that&#8217;s what usually happens to
fellows who take money from their
friends and put it into the metals. Possibly
he swallowed poison, and went to
sleep forever just to escape your wrath.
Let us take counsel of the heavens and
try to forget your sins. We must still
move the way the slipper pointed&mdash;northeast.
The road bends away from
the inn just right for a fresh start. We
depart, we skip, we are on our way, my
dear boy!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>They had walked nearly a mile when
Deering announced that he was tired,
and refused to go farther. He clambered
upon a stone wall at the roadside. On
a high ridge some distance away and
etched against the stars was a long,
low house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendid type of bungalow,&#8221; Hood
commented, throwing his legs over the
wall. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you have an eye for
nice effects&mdash;the roof makes a pretty
line against the stars, and those pines
beyond add a touch&mdash;a distinct touch.
Bungalows should always be planned
with a view to night effects; too bad
architects don&#8217;t always consider little
points like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering growled angrily. Suddenly
as his eyes gazed over the long, sloping
meadow that rose to the house he started
and laid his hand on Hood&#8217;s knee.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, steady! Always give a
ghost a chance,&#8221; murmured Hood.
</p>
<p>If the figure that danced across the
meadow was a ghost, it was an agile
one, and its costume represented a radical
departure from the traditional garb
of spirits doomed to walk the night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A boy, kicking up before he goes to
bed,&#8221; suggested Deering, forgetting his
sorrows for the moment as he contemplated
the dancing apparition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a clown&#8217;s suit, if I&#8217;m any judge,&#8221;
said Hood, jumping down from the wall
and moving cautiously up the slope.
The dancing figure suddenly darted away
through a clump of trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; remarked Hood when
they had reached the level where the
figure had executed its fantastic gyrations,
&#8220;of course, it&#8217;s none of our affair;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
but, in that story I was telling you about,
the heroine danced around at night in
strange costumes scaring people to death.
I&#8217;m not saying this ghost has read that
book&mdash;I&#8217;m merely stating a fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They found a path that zigzagged
across the meadow and followed it to
the edge of a ravine. Below they heard
the ripple of running water; and as an
agreeable accompaniment some one was
whistling softly.
</p>
<p>In a moment the rattle of loosened
gravel caused them to drop down by
the path. The pantalooned figure came
up, still whistling, and paused for a
moment to take breath. Deering, throwing
himself back from the path, grasped
a bush. The twigs rattled noisily, and
with a frightened &#8220;Oh!&#8221; the clown
darted away, nimbly and fleetly. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
followed a white blur in the starlight
for an instant and heard the patter of
light feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A girl,&#8221; whispered Deering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are right,&#8221; remarked
Hood, feeling about in the grass, &#8220;and
here&#8217;s a part of her costume.&#8221; He
picked up something white and held it
to his face. &#8220;She dropped her clown&#8217;s
cap when you began shaking the scenery.
I seem to remember that a girl&#8217;s hair is
sweet like that! In old times the
clown&#8217;s cap was supposed to possess
magic. Son, we have begun well! A
girl masquerading, happy victim of the
May madness&mdash;this is the jolliest thing
I&#8217;ve struck in years&mdash;a girl, out dancing
all by her lonesome under the stars&mdash;Columbine
playing Harlequin!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might as well be off,&#8221; he added,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
relighting his pipe. &#8220;We frightened her
ladyship, and she will dance no more
to-night. However, we have her cap,
which points the way for to-morrow&#8217;s
work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to hang around here
watching a girl cut monkey-shines!&#8221;
moaned Deering. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t forgotten
what we&#8217;re looking for, have
you!&#8221; he demanded, shaking his fist in
Hood&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Once more, be calm! Don&#8217;t you
see that you&#8217;re on the verge of a new
&#8216;Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream&#8217;; that the
world&#8217;s tired of work and gone back to
play! Don&#8217;t talk like a tired business
man whose wife has dragged him to see
one of Ibsen&#8217;s frolics&mdash;&#8216;Rosmersholm,&#8217;
for example&mdash;where they talk for three
hours and then jump in the well! The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
fact that there&#8217;s one girl left in the
world to dance under stars ought to
hearten you for anything. We don&#8217;t
find in this world the things we&#8217;re looking
for, Deering; we&#8217;ve got to be ready
for surprises. I won&#8217;t say that that&#8217;s
the girl who ran off with your bonds;
all I can say is that she&#8217;s as likely to be
the one as any girl I can think of. Tut!
Don&#8217;t imagine I don&#8217;t sympathize with
you in your troubles; but forget them,
that&#8217;s the ticket. This will do for to-night.
We&#8217;d better go back to the
Barton and to bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He yawned sleepily and started toward
the road. Deering caught him by the
arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just thinking&mdash;&#8221; he began.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinking is a bad habit, my boy.
Thought is the curse of the world. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
less thinking we do the better off we
are. Down at Pass Christian last winter
I sat under a tree for a solid month and
never thought a think. Most profitable
time I ever spent in my life. Camped
with a sneak-thief who was making a
tour of the Southern resorts&mdash;nice chap;
must tell you about him sometime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He chuckled as though the recollection
of his larcenous companion pleased
him tremendously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll go back to the
Barton just yet,&#8221; Deering suggested
timidly. &#8220;It&#8217;s possible, you know, that
that girl <i>might</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it!&#8221; exclaimed Hood
eagerly, clapping his hands upon Deering&#8217;s
shoulders. &#8220;The spell is taking
hold! Wait here a thousand years if
you like for that kid to come back, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
don&#8217;t bother about me. But cut out
your vulgar bond twaddle, and don&#8217;t
ask her if she stole your suitcase! As
like as not she&#8217;ll lead you to the end of
the rainbow, and show you a meal sack
bulging with red, red gold. Here&#8217;s her
cap&mdash;better keep it for good luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering stood, with the clown&#8217;s cap
in his hand, staring after Hood&#8217;s retreating
figure. It was not wholly an illusion
that he had experienced a change of
some sort, and he wondered whether
there might not be something in Hood&#8217;s
patter about the May madness. At
any rate, his troubles had slipped from
him, and he was conscious of a new and
delightful sense of freedom. Moreover,
he had been kidnapped by the oddest
man he had ever met, and he didn&#8217;t
care!
</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
</div>

<p>Beyond the bungalow rose a dark
strip of woodland, and suddenly, as
Deering&#8217;s eyes caught sight of it, he became
aware that the moon, which had
not appeared before that night, seemed
to be lingering cosily among the trees.
Even a victim of May madness hardly
sees moons where they do not exist, but
to all intents and purpose this <i>was</i> a
moon, a large round moon, on its way
down the horizon in the orderly fashion
of elderly moons. He turned toward
the road, then glanced back quickly to
make sure his eyes were not playing
tricks upon him. The moon was still
there, blandly staring. His powers of
orientation had often been tested; on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
hunting and fishing trips he had ranged
the wilderness without a compass, and
never come to grief. He was sure that
this huge orb was in the north, where
no moon of decent habits has any right
to be.
</p>
<p>With his eyes glued to this phenomenon,
he advanced up the slope. When
he reached the crest of the meadow the
moon still hung where he had first seen
it&mdash;a most unaccountable moon that
apparently lingered to encourage his investigations.
</p>
<p>He jumped a wall that separated the
meadow from the woodland, and advanced
resolutely toward the lunar mystery.
He found Stygian darkness in
among the pines: the moon, considering
its size, shed amazingly little light.
He crept toward it warily, and in a moment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
stood beneath the outward and
visible form of a moon cleverly contrived
of barrel staves and tissue-paper
with a lighted lantern inside, and thrust
into the crotch of a tree.
</p>
<p>As he contemplated it something
struck him&mdash;something, he surmised, that
had been flung by mortal hand, and a
pine-cone caught in his waistcoat collar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t spoil my moon,&#8221; piped
a voice out of the darkness. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
lot of trouble to make a moon!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Walking cautiously toward the wall,
he saw, against the star dusk of the open,
the girl in clown costume who had
danced in the meadow. She sat the
long way of the wall, her knees clasped
comfortably, and seemed in nowise disturbed
by his appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
I didn&#8217;t know it was <i>your</i> moon. I
thought it was just the regular old
moon that had got lost on the way
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t apologize. I rather hoped
somebody would come up to have a
look at it; but you&#8217;d better run along
now. This is private property, you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for the hint,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;But on a night when moons hang in
trees you can&#8217;t expect me to be scared
away so easily. And besides, I&#8217;m an
outlaw,&#8221; he ended in a tone meant to
be terrifying.
</p>
<p>She betrayed neither surprise nor fear,
but laughed and uttered a &#8220;Really!&#8221;
that was just such a &#8220;really&#8221; as any
well-bred girl might use at a tea, or
anywhere else that reputable folk congregate,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
to express faint surprise. Her
way of laughing was altogether charming.
A girl who donned a clown&#8217;s garb
for night prowling and manufactured
moons for her own amusement could
not have laughed otherwise, he reflected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A burglar?&#8221; she suggested with mild
curiosity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not professionally; but I&#8217;m seriously
thinking of going in for it. What do you
think of burgling as a career?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Interesting&mdash;rather&mdash;I should think,&#8221;
she replied after a moment&#8217;s hesitation,
as though she were weighing his suggestion
carefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And highway robbery appeals to
me&mdash;rather. It&#8217;s more picturesque, and
you wouldn&#8217;t have to break into houses.
I think I&#8217;d rather work in the open.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The chances of escape might be
better,&#8221; she admitted; &#8220;but you needn&#8217;t
try the bungalow down there, for there&#8217;s
nothing in it worth stealing. I give you
my word for that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hadn&#8217;t thought of the bungalow.
I had it in mind to begin by holding
up a motor. Nobody&#8217;s doing that
sort of thing just now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Capital!&#8221; she murmured pleasantly,
as though she found nothing extraordinary
in the idea. &#8220;So you&#8217;re really
new at the game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve <i>stolen</i> before, if that&#8217;s
what you mean, but I didn&#8217;t get much
fun out of it. I suppose after the first
fatal plunge the rest will come easier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say that&#8217;s true,&#8221; she assented.
There was real witchery in the girl&#8217;s
light, murmurous laugh.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>It seemed impossible to surprise her;
she was taking him as a matter of course&mdash;as
though sitting on a wall at night,
and talking to a strange young man
about stealing was a familiar experience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve joined Robin Hood&#8217;s band,&#8221; he
continued. &#8220;At least I&#8217;ve been adopted
by a new sort of Robin Hood who&#8217;s
travelling round robbing the rich to pay
the poor, and otherwise meddling in
people&#8217;s affairs&mdash;the old original Robin
Hood brought up to date. If it hadn&#8217;t
been for him I might be cooling my heels
in jail right now. He&#8217;s an expert on
jails&mdash;been in nearly every calaboose in
America. He&#8217;s tucked me under his
wing&mdash;persuaded me to take the highway,
and not care a hang for anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How delightful!&#8221; she replied, but so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
slowly that he began to fear that his
confidences had alarmed her. &#8220;That&#8217;s
too good to be true; you&#8217;re fooling,
aren&#8217;t you&mdash;really?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His eyes had grown accustomed to the
light, and her profile was now faintly
limned in the dusk. Hers was the
slender face of youth. The silhouette
revealed the straightest of noses and
the firmest of little chins. She was
young, so young that he felt himself
struggling in an immeasurable gulf of
years as he watched her. Apparently
such sophistication as she possessed was
in the things of the world of wonder, the
happy land of make-believe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keats would have liked a night like
this,&#8221; she said gently.
</p>
<p>Deering was silent. Keats was a
person whom he knew only as the subject
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
of a tiresome lecture in his English
course at college.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill Blake would have adored it,
but he would have had lambs in the
pasture,&#8221; she added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill Blake?&#8221; he questioned. &#8220;Do
you mean Billy Blake who was half-back
on the Harvard eleven last year?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She tossed her head and laughed
merrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I love that!&#8221; she replied lingeringly,
as though to prolong her joy in
his ignorance. &#8220;I was thinking of a
poet of that name who wrote a nice
verse something like this:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8216;I give you the end of a golden string;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>Only wind it into a ball,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>It will lead you in at Heaven&#8217;s gate,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>Built in Jerusalem&#8217;s wall.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>No girl had ever quoted poetry to
him before, and he was thinking more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
of her pretty way of repeating the
stanza&mdash;keeping time with her hands&mdash;than
of the verse itself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what&#8217;s the rest of
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there isn&#8217;t any rest of it! Don&#8217;t
you see that there couldn&#8217;t be anything
more&mdash;that it&#8217;s finished&mdash;a perfect little
poem all by itself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He played with a loosened bit of
stone, meekly conscious of his stupidity.
And he did not like to appear stupid
before a girl who danced alone in the
starlight and hung moons in trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t get it. I&#8217;d a lot
rather stay by this wall talking to you
than go to Jerusalem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be foolish to do that if you
really had the end of the golden string,
and could follow it to Paradise. I think
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
it means any nice place&mdash;just any place
where happiness is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was not getting on, and to gain
time he bade her repeat the stanza.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand now; I&#8217;ve
never gone in much for poetry, you
know,&#8221; he explained humbly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Burglars are natural poets, I suppose,&#8221;
she continued. &#8220;A burglar just
has to have imagination or he can&#8217;t
climb through the window of a house
he has never seen before. He must
imagine everything perfectly&mdash;the silver
on the sideboard, the watch under the
pillow, and the butler stealing down the
back stairs with a large, shiny pistol in
his hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; Deering agreed readily.
&#8220;And if he runs into a policeman on
the way out he&#8217;s got to imagine that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
it&#8217;s an old college friend and embrace
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t spoil a pretty idea that
way!&#8221; she admonished in a tone that
greatly softened the rebuke. &#8220;Come
to think of it, you haven&#8217;t told me your
name yet; of course, if you become a
burglar, you will have a great number
of names, but I&#8217;d like awfully to know
your true one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you seem nice and well
brought up for a burglar, and I liked
your going up to the moon and poking
your finger into it. That makes me
feel that I&#8217;d like to know you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the circumstances being as
they are, and being really a thief, you
mustn&#8217;t ask me to tell my real name;
for all I know you may be a detective
in disguise.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not&mdash;really,&#8221; she said&mdash;he found
her &#8220;reallys&#8221; increasingly enchanting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might call me Friar Tuck or
Little John. I&#8217;m travelling with Robin
Hood, you remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Tuck&mdash;that will be splendid!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now that you know my name
it&#8217;s only fair to tell me yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pierrette,&#8221; she answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His unconscious imitation of her
manner of uttering this phrase evoked
another merry laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, really,&#8221; she answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you live somewhere, of course&mdash;not
in the tree up there with your moon,
but in the bungalow, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I live wherever I am; that&#8217;s the
fun of playing all the time,&#8221; she replied
evasively. &#8220;<i>Poste restante</i>, the
Little Dipper. How do you like that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But just now your true domicile is
the bungalow?&#8221; he persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been stopping there for a
few days, that&#8217;s all. I haven&#8217;t any
home&mdash;not really,&#8221; she added as though
she found her homelessness the happiest
of conditions. She snapped her fingers
and recited:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<p>&#8220;Is that Keats or Blake?&#8221; he ventured
timidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>me</i>, you goose! But it&#8217;s only
an imitation&mdash;why, Stevenson, of course,
and pretty punk as you ought to know.
Gracious!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>She jumped down from the wall, on
the side toward the bungalow, and
stared up at the tree she had embellished
with her moon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The moon&#8217;s gone out, and I&#8217;ve got
to go <i>in</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, before you go, when can I
see you again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows!&#8221; she exclaimed unsympathetically;
but she waited as
though pondering the matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must see you again!&#8221; he persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shouldn&#8217;t say that it was
wholly essential to your happiness&mdash;or
mine! I can&#8217;t meet burglars&mdash;socially!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Burglars! But I&#8217;m not&mdash;&#8221; he cried
protestingly.
</p>
<p>She bent toward him with one hand
extended pleadingly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it! Don&#8217;t <i>say</i> it! If
you say you&#8217;re <i>not</i>, you won&#8217;t be any
fun any more!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then we&#8217;ll say I am&mdash;a terrible
freebooter&mdash;a bold, bad pirate,&#8221; he
growled. &#8220;Now, may I come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She mused a moment, then struck
her hands together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to the bungalow breakfast;
that&#8217;s a fine idea!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And may I bring Hood?&#8221; he asked,
leaning half-way across the wall in his
anxiety to conclude the matter before
she escaped. &#8220;He&#8217;s my boss, you understand,
and I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t shake
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly; bring Mr. Hood. Breakfast
at eight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And your home&mdash;your address&mdash;is
there in the bungalow?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you where my home is,
in a verse I made up specially; and my
address is care of the Little Dipper&mdash;there
it is, up there in the sky, all nice
and silvery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His gaze followed the pointing of her
finger. The Little Dipper, as an address
for the use of mortals, struck him
as rather remote. To his surprise she
advanced to the wall, rested her hands
upon it, and peered into his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this perfectly killing?&#8221; she
asked in a tone wholly different from
that in which she had carried on her
share of the colloquy.
</p>
<p>He experienced an agreeable thrill as
it flashed upon him that this was no
child, but a young woman who, knowing
the large world, had suddenly awakened
to a consciousness that encounters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
with strange young men by starlight
were not to be prolonged forever. In the
luminous dusk he noted anew the delicate
perfectness of her face, the fine
brow about which her hair had tumbled
from her late exertions. Her eyes
searched his face with honest curiosity&mdash;for
an instant only.
</p>
<p>Then she stepped back, as though to
mark a return to her original character,
and answered her own question with an
air of amused conviction:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> perfectly killing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His hand fumbled the cap in his
pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s something I found down
yonder&mdash;your clown&#8217;s cap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took it with a murmur of thanks,
and darted away toward the bungalow.
He heard her light step on the veranda
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
and then a door closed with a sharp
bang.
</p>
<p>Deering walked back to the inn with
his head high and elation throbbing in
his pulses. He observed groups of people
playing bridge in the inn parlor,
and he was filled with righteous contempt
for them. The May air had
changed his whole nature. He was not
the William B. Deering who had meditated
killing himself a few hours earlier.
A new joy had entered into him; he was
only afraid now that he might not live
forever!
</p>
<p>Hood slept tranquilly, his bed littered
with the afternoon&#8217;s New York
papers which evidently he had been
scissoring when he fell asleep. Deering&#8217;s
attitude toward the strange vagrant
had changed since his meeting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
with Pierrette. Hood might be as mad
as the traditional hatter, and yet there
was something&mdash;indubitably something&mdash;about
the man that set him apart from
the common run of mortals.
</p>
<p>Deering lay awake a long time rejoicing
in his new life, and when he
dreamed it was of balloon-like moons
cruising lazily over woods and fields,
pursued by innumerable Pierrettes in
spotted trousers and pointed caps.
</p>

</div>

<p>He awoke at seven, and looked in
upon Hood, who lay sprawled
upon his bed reading one of the battered
volumes of Borrow he carried in his bag.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your tub, son; I&#8217;ve had mine
and came back to bed to let you have
your sleep out. Marvellous man&mdash;Borrow.
Spring&#8217;s the time to read him.
We&#8217;ll have some breakfast and go out
and see what the merry old world has
to offer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With nice calculation he tossed the
book into the open bag on the further
side of the room, rose, and stretched
himself. Deering stifled an impulse to
scoff at his silk pajamas as hardly an appropriate
sleeping garb for one who professed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
to have taken vows of poverty.
Hood noted his glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Found these in some nabob&#8217;s house
at Bar Harbor last fall. Went up in
November, after all the folks had gone,
to have a look at the steely blue ocean;
camped in a big cottage for a few days.
Found a drawer full of these things and
took the pink ones. Wrote my thanks
on the villa&#8217;s stationery and pinned &#8217;em
to the fireplace. I hate to admit it,
son, but I verily believe I could stand
a little breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going out for breakfast,&#8221;
Deering remarked with affected carelessness.
&#8220;I accepted an invitation for
you last night. A girl up there at the
bungalow asked me; I told her about
you, and she seemed willing to stand
for it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The thought pleases me! You are
certainly doing well, my boy!&#8221; Hood
replied, dancing about on one foot as
he drew a sock on the other.
</p>
<p>He explained that a man should never
sit down while dressing; that the exercise
he got in balancing himself was of
the greatest value as a stimulus to the
circulation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a very nice girl, I think,&#8221;
Deering continued, showing his lathered
face at the bathroom door.
</p>
<p>He hadn&#8217;t expected Hood to betray
surprise, and he was not disappointed
in the matter-of-course fashion in which
his companion received the invitation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast is the one important meal
of the day,&#8221; Hood averred as he executed
a series of hops in his efforts to
land inside his trousers. &#8220;All great adventures
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
should be planned across breakfast
tables; centrepiece of cool fruits;
coffee of teasing fragrance, the toast
crisp; an egg perhaps, if the morning
labors are to be severe. I know a chap
in Boston who cuts out breakfast altogether.
Most melancholy person I ever
knew; peevish till one o&#8217;clock, then
throws in a heavy lunch that ruins him
for the rest of the day. What did you
say the adorable&#8217;s name was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pierrette,&#8221; Deering spluttered from
the tub.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Delightful!&#8221; cried Hood, flourishing
his hair-brushes. &#8220;Then you met the
dancing-girl! I must say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She had hung a moon in a tree! I
followed the moon and found the girl!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Always the way; it never fails,&#8221;
Hood commented, as though the finding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
of the girl had fully justified his
philosophy of life. &#8220;But we can&#8217;t fool
away much time at the bungalow; we&#8217;ve
got a lot to do to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Time!&#8221; cried Deering, &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to stay forever! You can&#8217;t expect me
to find a girl whose post-office address
is the Little Dipper, and then go coolly
off and forget about her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the right spirit, son,&#8221; Hood
remarked cautiously; &#8220;but we&#8217;ll see.
I&#8217;ll have a look at her and decide what&#8217;s
best for you. My business right now is
to keep you out of trouble. You can&#8217;t
tell about these moon girls; she may
have a wart on her nose when you see
her in daylight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering hooted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And she probably has parents who
may not relish the idea of having two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
strange men prowling about the premises
looking for breakfast. There are still a
few of those old-fashioned people left
in the world. It may be only a backdoor
hand-out for us, but I&#8217;ve sawed
wood for breakfast before now. I&#8217;ll
wait for you below; I want to see how
old Cassowary&#8217;s standing the racket.
The boy seemed a little cheerfuller last
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked to the bungalow which,
to Deering&#8217;s relief, was still perched on
the ridge as he had left it. He was
beset with misgivings as they entered
the gate and followed a hedge-lined
path that rose gradually to the house;
it might be a joke after all; but Hood&#8217;s
manner was reassuring. He swung his
stick and praised the landscape, and
when they reached the veranda banged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
the knocker noisily. A capped and
aproned maid opened the door immediately.
</p>
<p>Deering, struck with cowardice, found
his legs quaking and stepped back to
allow Hood to declare their purpose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have come for breakfast, lass,&#8221;
Hood announced, &#8220;and have brought
our appetites with us if that fact interests
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are expected,&#8221; said the maid;
&#8220;breakfast will be served immediately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She led the way across a long living-room
to the dining-room beyond, where
a table was set for three. The tangible
presence of the third plate caused Deering&#8217;s
heart to thump.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The host or hostess&mdash;?&#8221; Hood inquired
as the girl waited for them to
be seated.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The lady of the house wished me to
say that she would be here&mdash;in spirit!
Pressing duties called her elsewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering&#8217;s spirits sank. Pierrette,
then, was only a dream of the night,
and had never had the slightest intention
of meeting him at breakfast! The
maid curtsied and vanished through a
swing door.
</p>
<p>Hood, accepting the situation as he
found it, expressed his satisfaction as
a bowl of strawberries was placed on the
table, and as the door ceased swinging
behind the maid, laid his hand on Deering&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry; mere shyness
has driven our divinity away: you
can see for yourself that even a girl who
hangs moons in trees might shrink from
the shock of a daylight meeting with a
gentleman she had found amusing by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
starlight. Let it suffice that she provided
the breakfast according to schedule&mdash;that&#8217;s
highly encouraging. With strawberries
at present prices she has been
generous. This little disappointment
merely adds zest to the adventure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The hand of the maid as she changed
his plate at once interested Deering.
It was a slender, supple, well-kept hand,
browned by the sun. Her maid&#8217;s dress
was becoming; her cap merely served
to invite attention to her golden-brown
hair. Her coloring left nothing for the
heart to desire, and her brown eyes
called immediately for a second glance.
She was deft and quick; her graceful
walk in itself compelled admiration. As
the door closed upon her, Hood bent a
look of inquiry upon his brooding companion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps she&#8217;s the adorable&mdash;the true,
authentic Pierrette,&#8221; he suggested.
</p>
<p>Deering shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the other girl was not so tall
and her voice was different; it was wonderfully
sweet and full of laughter. I
couldn&#8217;t be fooled about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s mystery here&mdash;a game of
some kind. Mark the swish of silken
skirts; unless my eyes fail me, I caught
a glimpse of silken hose as she flitted
into the pantry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When an omelet had been served and
the coffee poured (she poured coffee
charmingly!) Hood called her back as
she was about to leave them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two men should never be allowed to
eat alone. If your mistress is not returning
at once, will you not do us the
honor to sit down with us?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; she said, biting her
lip to conceal a smile.
</p>
<p>Deering was on his feet at once and
drew out the third chair, which she accepted
without debate. She composedly
folded her arms on the edge of the table
as though she were in nowise violating
the rules set down for the guidance of
waitresses. Hood, finding the situation
to his taste, blithely assumed the lead
in the conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is perfectly proper for you to join
us at table,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;but formal
introductions would not be in keeping.
Still, your employer doubtless has some
familiar name for you, and you might
with propriety tell us what it is, so we
won&#8217;t need to attract your attention by
employing the vulgar &#8216;Say&#8217; or &#8216;Listen&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My mistress calls me Babette,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
answered, her lashes drooping becomingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfect!&#8221; cried Hood ecstatically.
&#8220;And we are two outlaws whose names
it is more discreet for us to withhold,
even if it were proper to exchange names
with a mere housemaid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering winced; it was indecent in
Hood to treat her as though she were a
housemaid when so obviously she was not.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend doesn&#8217;t mean to be rude,&#8221;
he explained; &#8220;the morning air always
makes him a little delirious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I know my place,&#8221; the girl
replied, &#8220;and I&#8217;m sure you gentlemen
mean to be kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t count the spoons after
we leave,&#8221; said Hood; &#8220;I assure you we
have no professional designs on the
house.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. Of course, if you
stole anything, it would be taken out of
my wages.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering&#8217;s interest in her increased.
</p>
<p>She rested her chin on her hand just
as his sister often did when they lingered
together at table. He was a good brother
and Constance was his standard. He
was sure that Constance would like
Pierrette&#8217;s maid. He resented Hood&#8217;s
patronizing attitude toward the girl, but
Hood&#8217;s spirits were soaring and there
was no checking him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Babette,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
trouble you with a question, not doubting
you will understand that my motives
are those of a philosopher whose whole
life has been devoted to the study of
the human race. May I ask you to
state in all sincerity whether you consider
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
apple sauce the essential accompaniment
of roast duck?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not; nor do I care for jelly with
venison,&#8221; she answered readily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Admirable! You are clearly no
child of convention but an independent
thinker! May I smoke? Thanks!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew out his pipe and turned
beaming to the glowering Deering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, my boy! Babette is one of
us&mdash;one of the great company of the
stars! Wonderful, how you find them
at every turn! Babette, my sister, I
salute you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She smiled and turned toward Deering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you, too, one of the Comrades
of Perpetual Youth?&#8221; she inquired
gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; Deering declared heartily,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
and they smiled at each other; &#8220;but
I&#8217;m only a novice&mdash;a brother of the
second class.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There can be no question of classes
in the great comradeship&mdash;either we are
or we are not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well spoken!&#8221; Hood assented,
pushing back his chair and crossing his
legs comfortably.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&mdash;do you and Pierrette think
about things the same way?&#8221; Deering
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We do&mdash;by not thinking,&#8221; Babette
replied. &#8220;Thinking among the comrades
is forbidden, is it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; Hood affirmed. &#8220;Our
young brother here is still a little weak in
the faith, but he&#8217;s taking to it splendidly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m new myself,&#8221; Babette confessed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re letter-perfect in the part,&#8221;
said Hood. &#8220;Perhaps you were driven
to it? Don&#8217;t answer if you would be
embarrassed by a confession.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl pondered a moment; her
face grew grave, and she played nervously
with the sugar-tongs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A man loved me and I sent him
away, and was sorry!&#8221; The last words
fell from her lips falteringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He will come back&mdash;if he is worthy
of one of the comradeship,&#8221; said Hood
consolingly. &#8220;Even now he may be
searching for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was unkind to him; I was very
hard on him! And I&#8217;ve been afraid&mdash;sometimes&mdash;that
I should never see him
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering thought he saw a glint of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
tears in her eyes. She rose hastily and
asked with a wavering smile:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s nothing further&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not food&mdash;if you mean that,&#8221; said
Hood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But about Pierrette!&#8221; Deering exclaimed
despairingly. &#8220;If she&#8217;s likely
to come, we must wait for her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather advise you against it,&#8221; the
girl answered. &#8220;I have no idea when
she will come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They rose instinctively as she passed
out. The door fanned a moment and
was still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; demanded Deering ironically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t speak to me in that
tone,&#8221; responded Hood. &#8220;This was your
breakfast, not mine; you needn&#8217;t scold
me if it didn&#8217;t go to suit you! Ah, what
have we here!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>He had drawn back a curtain at one
end of the dining-room, disclosing a
studio beyond. It was evidently a practical
workshop and bore traces of recent
use. Deering passed him and strode
toward an easel that supported a canvas
on which the paint was still wet.
He cried out in astonishment:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the moon girl&mdash;that&#8217;s the
girl I talked to last night&mdash;clown clothes
and all! She&#8217;s sitting on the wall there
just as I found her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A sophisticated brush; no amateur&#8217;s
job,&#8221; Hood muttered, squinting at the
canvas. &#8220;Seems to me I&#8217;ve seen that
sort of thing somewhere lately&mdash;Pantaloon,
Harlequin, Columbine, and Clown&mdash;latest
fad in magazine covers. We&#8217;re
in the studio of a popular illustrator&mdash;there&#8217;s
a bunch of proofs on the table,
and those things on the floor are from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
the same hand. Signature in the corner
a trifle obscure&mdash;Mary B. Taylor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She may be Babette,&#8221; Deering suggested.
&#8220;Suppose I call her and ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hood, having become absorbed in a
portfolio of pen-and-ink sketches of
clowns, harlequins, and columbines, subjects
in which the owner of the studio
apparently specialized, paid no heed to
the suggestion. When Deering returned
he was gazing critically at a sketch
showing a dozen clowns executing a
spirited dance on a garden-wall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s skipped! There isn&#8217;t a soul
on the place,&#8221; Deering announced dejectedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all surprising; probably gone
to join her model, Pierrette. And we&#8217;d
better clear out before we learn too
much; life ceases to be interesting when
you begin to find the answers to riddles.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Pierrette is probably a friend of the
artist, and plays model for the fun of
it. The same girl is repeated over and
over again in these drawings&mdash;from
which I argue that Pierrette likes to pose
and Babette enjoys painting her. We
mustn&#8217;t let this affect the general illusion.
The next turn of the road will
doubtless bring us to something that
can&#8217;t be explained so easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it doesn&#8217;t bring us to Pierrette&mdash;&#8221;
began Deering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut! None of that! For all you
know it may bring us to something infinitely
better. Remember that this is
mid-May, and anything may happen
before June kindles the crimson ramblers.
Let us be off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Half-way across the living-room Deering
stopped suddenly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My bag&mdash;my suitcase!&#8221; he shouted.
</p>
<p>A suitcase it was beyond question,
placed near the door as though to arrest
their attention. Deering pounced upon
it eagerly and flung it open.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right&mdash;the stuff&#8217;s here!&#8221; he
cried huskily.
</p>
<p>He began throwing out the packets
that filled the case, glancing hurriedly
at the seals. Hood lounged near, watching
him languidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most unfortunate,&#8221; he remarked,
noting the growing satisfaction on Deering&#8217;s
face as he continued his examination.
&#8220;Now that you&#8217;ve found that
rubbish, I suppose there&#8217;ll be no holding
you; you&#8217;ll go back to listen to the
ticker just when I had begun to have
some hope of you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Pierrette that took it; it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
couldn&#8217;t have been this artist girl,&#8221;
said Deering, excitedly whipping out
his penknife and slitting one of the
packages. A sheaf of blank wrapping-paper
fluttered to the floor. His face
whitened and he gave a cry of dismay.
&#8220;Robbed! Tricked!&#8221; he groaned, staring
at Hood.
</p>
<p>Hood picked up the paper and scrutinized
the seal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;S. J. Deering, personal,&#8221; he read in
the wax. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose that
girl has taken the trouble to forge your
father&#8217;s private seal, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering feverishly tore open the other
packages.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All alike; the stuff&#8217;s gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Perspiration beaded his forehead. He
stared stupidly at the worthless paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be grateful, son,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
Hood; &#8220;yesterday you thought yourself
a thief&mdash;now that load&#8217;s off your
mind, and you know yourself for an
honest man. General rejoicing seems to
be in order. Looks as though your
parent had robbed himself&mdash;rather a
piquant situation, I must say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He carried the wrappers to the window-seat
and examined them more
closely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seals were all intact. &#8216;The Tyringham
estate,&#8217;&#8221; he read musingly. &#8220;What
do you make of that?&#8221; he asked Deering,
who remained crumpled on the floor
beside the suitcase.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an estate father was executor
of&mdash;it&#8217;s a long story. Old man
Tyringham had been a customer of his,
and left a will that made it impossible
to close the estate till his son had reached
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
a certain age. The final settlement was
to be made this summer. But my God,
Hood, do you suppose father&mdash;my father
could be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A defaulter?&#8221; Hood supplied
blandly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible!&#8221; roared Deering.
&#8220;Father&#8217;s the very soul of honor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say he is,&#8221; remarked Hood
carelessly. &#8220;So were you till greed led
you to pilfer your governor&#8217;s strong
box. Let us be tolerant and withhold
judgment. It&#8217;s enough that your own
skirts are clear. Put that stuff out of
sight; we must flit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hood set off for the Barton Arms at a
brisk pace, talking incessantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This whole business is bully beyond
my highest expectations. By George,
it&#8217;s almost too good to be true! Critics
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
of the drama complain that the average
amateur&#8217;s play ends with every act;
but so far in our adventures every incident
leads on to something else. Perfectly
immense that somebody had
beaten you to the bonds!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering&#8217;s emotions were beyond utterance.
It was a warm morning, and
he did not relish carrying the suitcase,
whose recovery had plunged him into
a despair darker than that caused by
its loss.
</p>
<p>At a turn in the road Hood paused,
struck his stick heavily upon the ground,
and drew out the slipper. He whirled
it in the air three times and twice it
pointed east. He thrust it back into
his pocket with a sigh of satisfaction
and brushed the dust from his hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Once more we shall follow the pointing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
slipper. Yesterday it led us to the
moon girl, the bungalow, and the suitcase;
now it points toward the mysterious
east, and no telling what new
delights!&#8221;

<h2>VI</h2>
</div>

<p>Hood and Deering found Cassowary
sitting in the machine in
the inn yard reading a newspaper; this
Hood promptly seized and scanned with
his trained eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the bags aboard? Ah, I see
you have been forehanded, Cassowary!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering went to the inn office and
came out with a number of telegrams
which he read as he slowly crossed the
yard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of this?&#8221; he
asked weakly. The yellow sheets shook
in his hand and his face was white. &#8220;I
wired to a bank and a club in San Francisco
last night, and they&#8217;ve answered
that father isn&#8217;t in San Francisco and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
hasn&#8217;t been there! And I wired the
people Constance was to visit at Pasadena,
and they don&#8217;t know anything
about her. Just look at these things!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like straight information, but
why worry?&#8221; remarked Hood, scanning
the telegrams.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should father lie to me?
Why should Constance say she was
going to California if she wasn&#8217;t?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy, don&#8217;t ask me such
questions!&#8221; Hood remarked with an
injured air. &#8220;You are guilty of the
gravest error in sending telegrams without
consulting me! How can we trust
ourselves to Providence if you persist
in sending telegrams! If you do this
again, I shall be seriously displeased,
and you mustn&#8217;t displease Hood. Hood
is very ugly in his wrath.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>Deering was at the point of tears.
Hood was a fool, and he wished to tell
him so, but the words stuck in his
throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We move eastward toward the Connecticut
border, Cassowary,&#8221; Hood ordered
and pushed Deering into the machine.
</p>
<p>Hood was as merry as the morning
itself, and talked ceaselessly as they
rolled through the country, occasionally
bidding Cassowary slow down and give
heed to his discourse. The chauffeur
listened with a grin, glancing guardedly
at Deering, who stared grimly ahead
with an unlighted cigar in his mouth.
He was not to be disturbed in his
meditations upon the blackness of the
world by the idiotic prattle of a madman.
For half an hour Hood had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
been describing his adventures with a
Dublin University man, whose humor
he pronounced the keenest and most
satisfying he had ever known. He had
gathered from this person an immense
fund of lore relating to Irish superstitions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He left me just when I had learned
to love him,&#8221; Hood concluded mournfully.
&#8220;Became fascinated with a
patent-medicine faker we struck at a
county fair in Indiana. He was so
tickled over the way the long-haired
doctor played the banjo and jollied the
crowd that he attached himself to his
caravan. That Irishman was one of
the most agreeable men to be in jail
with that I ever knew; even hardened
murderers would cotton to him. That
spire over there must be Addington.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
The inn is nothing to boast of, but we&#8217;d
better tackle it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His gayety at luncheon once more
won Deering to a cheerier view of his
destiny. Hood called for the proprietor
and lectured him roundly for offering
canned-blueberry pie. The fact that
blueberries were out of season made no
difference to the outraged Hood; pie
produced from a can was a gross imposition.
He cited legal decisions covering
such cases and intimated that he might
bring proceedings. As the innkeeper
strode angrily away an elderly woman
at a neighboring table addressed the
dining-room on the miserable incompetence
of the pastry-cooks of these later
times, winding up by thanking Hood
heartily for his protest. She was from
Boston, she announced, and the declining
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
intellectual life of that city she attributed
to the deterioration of its pie.
</p>
<p>Hood rose and gravely replied in a
speech of five minutes, much to the delight
of two girls at the old lady&#8217;s table.
Hood wrote his name on the menu card,
and bade the giggling waitress hand it
to the lady from Boston. Her young
companions conferred for a moment,
and then sent back a card on which
appeared these names neatly pencilled:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' font-variant:small-caps; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Maid Marian</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>The Queen of Sheba</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>The Duchess of Suffolk (Mass.)</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; Hood remarked to
Deering after he had bowed elaborately
to the trio, &#8220;I tell you the whole world&#8217;s
caught step with us! That lady and her
two nieces, or granddaughters as the
case may be, are under the spell, just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
as you and I are and Cassowary and
your Pierrette and Babette of the
bungalow. If only you could yield
yourself to the May spirit, how happy
we might be! Just think of Cassowary;
worth a million dollars and eating his
lunch with the chauffeurs somewhere
below stairs and picking up much information
that he will impart to me
later! What a bully world this would
be if all mankind followed my system:
stupid conventions all broken-down; the
god of mirth holding his sides as he
contemplates the world at play! You
may be sure that old lady is a stickler
for the proprieties when she&#8217;s at home;
widow of a bishop most likely. Those
girls have been carefully reared, you
can see that, but full of the spirit of
mischief. The moment I tackled that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
stupid innkeeper about his monstrous
pie they felt the drawing of the mystic
tie that binds us together with silken
cords. Very likely they, like us, are
in search of adventure, and if our own
affairs were less urgent I should certainly
cultivate their further acquaintance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lady who called herself the Duchess
of Suffolk (Mass.) was undoubtedly
a person of consequence and the possessor
of a delightful humor. Deering
assumed that she and her companions
were abroad upon a lark of some kind
and were enjoying themselves tremendously.
Hood&#8217;s spell renewed its grip
upon him. It occurred to him that the
whole world might have been touched
with the May madness, and that the
old order of things had passed forever.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
It seemed ages since he had watched
the ticker in his father&#8217;s office. As they
sat smoking on the veranda the Duchess
of Suffolk, the Queen of Sheba, and
Maid Marian came out and entered a
big car. The old lady bowed with dignity
as the car moved off; the girls
waved their hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfect!&#8221; Hood muttered as he returned
their salutations. &#8220;We may
never meet again in this world, but
the memory of this encounter will abide
with me forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to appear fussy,
Hood,&#8221; Deering began good-naturedly,
&#8220;but would you mind telling me what&#8217;s
next on your programme?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the slightest. It&#8217;s just occurred
to me that it would be well to
dine to-night in one of the handsome
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
villas scattered through these hills. Still
following the slipper, we shall choose
one somewhere east of the inn and present
ourselves confidently at the front
door. Failing there, we shall assault the
postern and, perhaps, enrich our knowledge
of life with the servants&#8217; gossip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some famous kennels in
this neighborhood, and I&#8217;d hate awfully
to have an Airedale bite a hole in my
leg,&#8221; Deering suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy, that&#8217;s the tamest
thing that could happen to us! My
calves are covered with scars from dogs&#8217;
teeth; you soon get hardened to canine
ferocity. We&#8217;ll take a tramp for an
hour to work the fuzz off our gray
matter, and then a nap to freshen us
up for the evening. We shall learn
much to-night; I&#8217;m confident of that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>There seemed to be no way of escaping
Hood or changing his mind once he
announced a decision. The programme
was put through exactly as he had indicated.
The important thing about
the tramp was that Cassowary accompanied
them on the walk, and Deering
found him both agreeable and interesting.
He discoursed of polo, last year&#8217;s
Harvard-Yale football game, and ice-boating,
in which he seemed deeply experienced.
</p>
<p>Hood left them to look for hieroglyphics
on a barn which he said was
a veritable palimpsest of cryptic notations
of roving thieves.
</p>
<p>Cassowary&#8217;s manner underwent a
marked change when he and Deering
were alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to give the old boy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
the slip,&#8221; he said earnestly, &#8220;I want
you to give me notice. I&#8217;m not going
to be left alone with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Their eyes met in a long scrutiny;
then Deering laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you feel about it,
but, by George, I&#8217;m afraid to shake him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly my fix,&#8221; Cassowary
answered. &#8220;I was in a bad way when
he picked me up: just about ready to
jump off a high building and let it go
at that. And I must say he does make
things seem brighter. He mustn&#8217;t see
us talking off key, as he&#8217;d say, but I&#8217;d
like to ask you this: what&#8217;s he running
away from? That&#8217;s what worries me.
What&#8217;s he grabbing newspapers for all
the time and slashing out ads and other
queer stuff?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me there,&#8221; Deering replied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
soberly. &#8220;We ran into some men
the other night who he said were detectives
looking for him, but it didn&#8217;t
seem to worry him any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing new in <i>that</i>. We&#8217;ve
struck a number of men who apparently
were looking for somebody, and he
greatly enjoys chaffing them. If he&#8217;s
really a crook, he wouldn&#8217;t be exposing
himself to arrest as he does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hood was now returning from his
investigations of the barn, and as he
crossed the pasture was examining a
bunch of the newspaper clippings with
which his pockets were stuffed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid of getting
into trouble with him,&#8221; Cassowary remarked
admiringly. &#8220;He pulls off
things you wouldn&#8217;t think could be
done. He&#8217;s a marvel, that man!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Old Bill Fogarty&#8217;s been ripping into
the country stores in these parts,&#8221; began
Hood volubly; &#8220;found his mark
on the barn, all right. Amusing cuss,
Fogarty. Sawed himself out of most
of the jails between here and Bangor.
We&#8217;ll probably meet up with him somewhere.
It&#8217;s about time to go back for
that snooze, boys. To the road again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He strode off singing, in a very good
tenor voice, snatches from Italian operas,
and his pace was so rapid that his companions
were hard pressed to keep up
with him.

<h2>VII</h2>
</div>

<p>Evening dress was becoming to
Hood, enhancing the distinction
which his rough corduroys never wholly
obscured. He surveyed Deering critically,
gave a twist to his tie, and said
it was time to be off. As they drove
slowly through the country he discussed
the various houses they passed, speculating
as to the entertainment they
offered. He finally ordered Cassowary
to stop at the entrance to an imposing
estate, where a large colonial mansion
stood some distance from the highway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This strikes me as promising,&#8221; he
remarked, rising in the car and craning
his neck to gain a view of the house
through the shrubbery. &#8220;Drive in, Cassowary,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
and stand by with the car till
you see whether we have to run for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave the electric annunciator a
prolonged push, and as a butler opened
the door advanced into the hall with
his most authoritative air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hood and Mr. Tuck. I trust I
correctly understood that we dine at
seven.&#8221; The man eyed them with surprise
but took their coats and hats.
&#8220;We are expected. Please announce
us immediately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering followed him bewilderedly
into the drawing-room and planted himself
close to the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Assurance, my dear boy, conquers
all things,&#8221; Hood declaimed. &#8220;This
stuff looks like real Chippendale, and
the rugs seem to be genuine.&#8221; He
sniffed contemptuously as he posed before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
a long mirror for a final inspection
of his raiment. &#8220;It always pains me
to detect the odor of boiled vegetables
when I enter a strange house. Architects
tell me that it is almost impossible
to prevent&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>A woman&#8217;s figure flashed in the mirror
beside him, and he whirled round and
bowed from the hips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust you are not so lacking in the
sense of hospitality that you find yourself
considering means of ejecting us.
My comrade and I are weary from a
long journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Turning quickly, her gaze fell upon
Deering, who was stealing on tiptoe
toward the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; commanded Hood.
</p>
<p>Deering paused and sheepishly faced
his hostess.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>She was a small, trim, graceful woman,
of the type that greets middle life smilingly
and with no fear of what may lie
beyond. Her dark hair had whitened,
but her rosy cheeks belied its insinuations.
She viewed Deering with frank
curiosity, but with no indication of alarm.
She was not a woman one would consciously
annoy, and Deering&#8217;s face burned
as he felt her eyes inspecting him from
head to foot. He had never before
been so heartily ashamed of himself;
once out of this scrape, he meant to
escape from Hood and lead a circumspect,
orderly life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is Hood and which is Tuck?&#8221;
the woman asked with a faint smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The friar is the gentleman standing
on one foot at your right,&#8221; Hood answered.
&#8220;Conscious of my unworthiness,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
I plead guilty to being Hood&mdash;Hood
the hobo delectable, the tramp incomprehensible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Incomprehensible,&#8221; she repeated;
&#8220;you strike me as altogether obvious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never made a greater mistake,&#8221;
Hood returned with asperity. &#8220;But the
question that now agitates us is simply
this: do we eat or do we not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering looked longingly at a chair
with which he felt strongly impelled to
brain his suave, unruffled companion.
Hood apparently was hardened to such
encounters, and stood his ground unflinchingly.
All Deering&#8217;s instincts of
chivalry were roused by the little
woman, who had every reason for turning
them out of doors. He resolved to
make it easy for her to do so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon&mdash;&#8221; he faltered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>Hood signalled to him furiously behind
her back to maintain silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No apology would be adequate,&#8221; she
remarked with dignity. &#8220;We&#8217;d better
drop that and consider your errand on
its strict merits.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Admirably said, madam,&#8221; Hood rejoined
readily. &#8220;We ask nothing of you
but seats at your table and the favor of
a little wholesome and stimulating conversation,
which I refuse to believe you
capable of denying us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A clock somewhere began to boom
seven. She waited for the last stroke
to die away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I make it a rule never to deny food
to any applicant, no matter how unworthy.
You may remain.&#8221;
</p>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>Deering had hardly adjusted himself
to this when an old gentleman entered
the room, and with only the most casual
glance at the two pilgrims walked to
the grand piano, shook back his cuffs,
and began playing Mendelssohn&#8217;s
&#8220;Spring Song,&#8221; as though that particular
melody were the one great passion
of his life. When he had concluded he
rose and shook down his cuffs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that isn&#8217;t music,&#8221; he demanded,
walking up to the amazed Deering, who
still clung to his post by the door, &#8220;what
is it? Answer me that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You played it perfectly,&#8221; Deering
stammered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; he demanded, whirling
upon Hood, &#8220;what have you to say,
sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The great master himself would have
envied your touch,&#8221; Hood replied.
</p>
<p>The old gentleman glared. &#8220;Rot!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
he ejaculated; and then, turning to the
mistress of the house, he asked: &#8220;Do
these ruffians dine with us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem about to do us that
honor. My father, Mr. Hood, and&mdash;Mr.
Tuck. Shall we go out to dinner?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The gentleman she had introduced as
her father glared again&mdash;a separate glare
for each&mdash;and, advancing with a ridiculous
strut, gave the lady his arm.
</p>
<p>In the hall Hood intercepted Deering
in the act of effecting egress by way of
the front door. His fingers dug deeply
into his nervous companion&#8217;s arm as
he dragged him along, talking in his
characteristic vein:
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Tuck, it&#8217;s a pleasure to
find ourselves at last in a home whose
appointments speak for breeding and
taste. The portrait on our right bears
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
all the marks of a genuine Copley.
Madam, may I inquire whether I correctly
attribute that portrait to our
great American master?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite right,&#8221; she answered
over her shoulder. &#8220;The subject of
the portrait is my great-great-grandfather.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Tuck!&#8221; cried Hood jubilantly,
still clutching Deering&#8217;s arm,
&#8220;fate has again been kind to us; we
are among folk of quality, as I had
already guessed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The dining-room was in dark oak;
the glow from concealed burners shed
a soft light upon a round table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will sit at my right, Mr. Hood,
and Mr. Tuck by my father on the
other side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering pinched himself to make sure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
he was awake. The next instant the
room whirled, and he clutched the back
of his chair for support. A girl came
into the room and walked quickly to
the seat beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr Hood and Mr. Tuck, my
daughter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She hesitated, and the girl laughingly
ejaculated: &#8220;Pierrette!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, won&#8217;t you, please,&#8221; said
the little lady; but Deering stood staring
open-mouthed at the girl.
</p>
<p>Beyond question, she was the girl of
the Little Dipper; there was no mistaking
her. At this point the old gentleman
afforded diversion by rising and
bowing first to Hood and then to Deering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Pantaloon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My
daughter is Columbine, as you may have
guessed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very nice to see you again,&#8221;
Pierrette remarked to Deering; &#8220;but,
of course, I didn&#8217;t know you would be
here. How goes the burgling?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;er&mdash;haven&#8217;t got started yet. I
find it a little difficult&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re not getting much
fun out of the adventurous life,&#8221; she
suggested, noting the wild look in his
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand things, that&#8217;s
all,&#8221; he confessed, &#8220;but I think I&#8217;m
going to like it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You find it a little too full of surprises?
Oh, we all do at first! You
see grandfather is seventy, and he never
grew up, and mamma is just like him.
And I&mdash;&#8221; She shrugged her shoulders
and flashed a smile at her grandparent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wonderful&mdash;bewildering,&#8221;
Deering stammered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>The old gentleman was inveighing at
Hood upon America&#8217;s lack of mirth;
the American people had utterly lost
their capacity for laughter, the old man
averred. Deering&#8217;s fork beat a lively
tattoo on his plate as he attacked his
caviar.
</p>
<p>And then another girl entered and
walked to the remaining vacant place
opposite him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Smeraldina,&#8221; murmured the mistress
of the house, glancing round the table,
and calmly finishing a remark the girl&#8217;s
entrance had interrupted.
</p>
<p>Deering&#8217;s last hold upon sanity slowly
relaxed. Unless his wits were entirely
gone, he was facing his sister Constance.
She wore a dark gown, with white collar
and cuffs, and her manner was marked
by the restraint of an upper servant of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
some sort who sits at the family table
by sufferance. He was about to gasp
out her name when she met his eyes
with a glinty stare and a quick shake
of the head. Then Pierrette addressed
a remark to her&mdash;kindly meant to relieve
her embarrassment&mdash;referring to
a walk over the hills they had taken together
that afternoon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Smeraldina!&#8221; cried Pantaloon,
&#8220;how is that last chapter? Columbine
refuses to show me any more of the book
until it is finished. I look to you to make
a duplicate for my private perusal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here was light of a sort upon the
strange household; its mistress was a
writer of books; Constance was her
secretary; but the effort to explain
how his sister came to be masquerading
in such a rôle left him doddering, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
that she should refuse to recognize him&mdash;her
own brother!
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that new book is half as good as
&#8216;The Madness of May,&#8217;&#8221; Pantaloon was
saying, &#8220;I shall not be disappointed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s much better; infinitely
better!&#8221; Constance declared warmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tuck, do you realize we are in the
presence of greatness?&#8221; cried Hood.
Then, turning to Columbine: &#8220;The
author will please accept my heartiest
congratulations!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you kindly,&#8221; replied the
hostess. &#8220;I&#8217;m fortunate in my secretary.
Smeraldina is my fifth, and the
first who ever made a suggestion that
was of the slightest use. The others
had no imagination; they all objected
to being called Smeraldina, and one of
them was named Smith!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m the first who ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
had the impertinence to suggest anything,&#8221;
Constance answered humbly.
</p>
<p>This was not the sister Deering had
known in his old life before he fell victim
to the prevailing May madness.
She was in servitude and evidently trying
to make the best of it. She had been
the jolliest, the most high-spirited of
girls, and to find her now meekly acting
as amanuensis to a lady whose very
name he didn&#8217;t know sent his imagination
stumbling through the blindest of
dark alleys.
</p>
<p>Only the near presence of Pierrette
and her perfect composure and good-nature
checked his inclination to stand
up and shout to relieve his feelings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t mind my not turning
up for breakfast,&#8221; she remarked in
her low, bell-like tones.
</p>
<p>Deering&#8217;s hopes rose. That breakfast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
at the bungalow seemed the one
tangible incident of his twenty-four
hours in Hood&#8217;s company and, perhaps,
if he let her take the lead, he might
find himself on solid earth again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d been week-ending with Babette;
she&#8217;s an artist, you know, and I&#8217;m
posing for another of mamma&#8217;s heroines.
Babette got me up at daylight to pose
for the last picture and then&mdash;I skipped
and left her to manage the breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her laugh as she said this established
her identity beyond question. For a
moment the thought of the packages of
worthless wrapping-paper he had found
in his suitcase chilled his happiness in
finding her again; but it had not been
her fault; the unbroken seals fully established
her innocence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You understand, of course, that it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
a dark secret that mother writes. She
had scribbled for her own amusement
all her life, and published &#8216;The Madness
of May&#8217; just to see what the public
would do to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that it&#8217;s immensely
amusing,&#8221; remarked Deering, thrilling
as she turned toward him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you haven&#8217;t read it!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Mamma, Mr. Tuck hasn&#8217;t read your
book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My young friend is just beginning
his education,&#8221; interposed Hood. &#8220;I
unhesitatingly pronounce &#8216;The Madness
of May&#8217; a classic&mdash;something the tired
world has been awaiting for years!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; cried Pantaloon. &#8220;You are
quite right, sir. &#8216;The Madness of May&#8217;
isn&#8217;t a novel, it&#8217;s a text-book on happiness!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Truer words were never spoken!&#8221;
exclaimed Hood with enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; began Deering, when
it was possible to address Pierrette directly
again, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I was
built for this life. I find myself checking
off the alphabet on my fingers every
few minutes to see if I have gone plumb
mad!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She bent toward him with entreaty
in her eyes. He observed that they
were brown eyes! In the starlight he
had been unable to judge of their color,
and he was chagrined that he hadn&#8217;t
guessed at that first interview that she
was a brown-eyed girl. Only a brown-eyed
girl would have hung a moon in a
tree! Brown eyes are immensely eloquent
of all manner of pleasant things&mdash;such
as mischief, mirth, and dreams.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
Moreover, brown eyes are so highly
sensitized that they receive and transmit
messages in the most secret of
ciphers, and yet always with circumspection.
He was perfectly satisfied with
Pierrette&#8217;s eyes and relieved that they
were not blue, for blue eyes may be cold,
and the finest of black eyes are sometimes
dull. Gray eyes alone&mdash;misty,
fathomless gray eyes&mdash;share imagination
with brown ones. But neither a blue-eyed
nor a black-eyed nor a gray-eyed
Pierrette was to be thought of. Pierrette&#8217;s
eyes were brown, as he should
have known, and what she was saying
to him was just what he should have
expected once the color of her eyes had
been determined.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t! You must never try
to <i>understand</i> things like this! You
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
see grandpa and mamma love larking,
and this is a lark. We&#8217;re always larking,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hood&#8217;s voice rose commandingly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Once when I was in jail in Utica&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering regretted his shortness of leg
that made it impossible to kick his erratic
companion under the table. But
a chorus of approval greeted this promising
opening, and Hood continued relating
with much detail the manner in
which he had once been incarcerated
in company with a pickpocket whose
accomplishments and engaging personality
he described with gusto. There
was no denying that Hood talked well,
and the strict attention he was receiving
evoked his best efforts.
</p>
<p>Deering, covertly glancing at his sister,
found that she too hung upon Hood&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
words. Her presence in the house still
presented an enigma with which his
imagination struggled futilely, but no
opportunity seemed likely to offer for an
exchange of confidences.
</p>
<p>Constance was a thoroughbred and
played her part flawlessly. Her treatment
by her employer left nothing to
be desired; the amusing little grandfather
appealed to her now and then
with unmistakable liking, and the smiles
that passed between her and Pierrette
were evidence of the friendliest relationship.
</p>
<p>The dinner was served in a leisurely
fashion that encouraged talk, and Deering
availed himself of every chance for a
tête-à-tête with Pierrette. She graciously
came down out of the clouds and conversed
of things that were within his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
comprehension&mdash;of golf and polo for example&mdash;and
then passed into the unknown
again. But in no way did she
so much as hint at her identity. When
she referred to her mother or grandfather
she employed the pseudonyms by
which he already knew them. While
they were on the subject of polo he
asked her if she had witnessed a certain
match.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I was there!&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;And, of course, I saw you; you were
the star performer. At tea afterward
I saw you again, surrounded by admirers.&#8221;
She laughed at his befuddlement.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s against all the rules to
try to unmask me! Of course, I know
you, but maybe you will never know
me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you are cruel enough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
to prolong my agony forever! I can&#8217;t
stand this much longer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps some day,&#8221; she answered
quietly and meeting his eager gaze
steadily, &#8220;we shall meet just as the
people of the world meet, and then
maybe you won&#8217;t like me at all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After this the world will never be
the same planet again. Hereafter my
business will be to follow you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She broke in laughingly, &#8220;even to
the Little Dipper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even to the farthest star!&#8221; he answered.
</p>
<p>After coffee had been served in the
drawing-room, Hood, again dominating
the company (much to Deering&#8217;s disgust),
suggested music. Pierrette contributed
a flashing, golden Chopin waltz
and Pantaloon Schubert&#8217;s &#8220;Serenade,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
which he played atrociously, whereupon
Hood announced that he would sing a
Scotch ballad, which he proceeded to
do surprisingly well. The evening could
not last forever, and Deering chafed at
his inability to detach Pierrette from
the piano; but she was most provokingly
submissive to Hood&#8217;s demand that the
music continue. Deering had protested
that he didn&#8217;t sing; he hated himself
for not singing!
</p>
<p>He fidgeted awhile; then, finding
the others fully preoccupied with their
musical experiments, quietly left the
drawing-room. It had occurred to him
that Constance, who had disappeared
when they left the table, might be seeking
a chance to speak to him and he
strolled through the library (a large
room with books crowding to the ceiling)
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
to a glass door opening into a conservatory,
which was dark save for the
light from the library. He was about
to turn away when an outer door opened
furtively and Cassowary stepped in from
the grounds. The chauffeur glanced
about nervously as though anxious to
avoid detection.
</p>
<p>As Deering watched him a shadow
darted by, and his sister&mdash;unmistakably
Constance in the dark gown with its
white collar and cuffs that she had worn
at dinner&mdash;moved swiftly toward the
chauffeur. She gave him both hands;
he kissed her eagerly; then they began
talking earnestly. For several minutes
Deering heard the blurred murmur of
rapid question and reply; then, evidently
disturbed by an outburst of merriment
from the drawing-room, the two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
parted with another hand-clasp and kiss,
and Cassowary darted through the outer
door.
</p>
<p>Constance waited a moment, as though
to compose herself, and then began retracing
her steps down the conservatory
aisle. As she passed his hiding-place
Deering stepped out and seized her
arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is what&#8217;s in the wind, is it?&#8221;
he demanded roughly. &#8220;I suppose you
don&#8217;t know that that man&#8217;s a bad lot,
a worthless fellow Hood picked up in
the hope of reforming him! For all I
know he may be the chauffeur he pretends
to be!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She freed herself and her eyes flashed
angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re saying!
That man is a gentleman, and if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
he went to pieces for a while it was my
fault. I met him at the Drakes&#8217; last
year when you were away hunting in
Canada. He came to our house afterward,
but for some reason father took
one of his strong dislikes to him, and
forbade my seeing him again. I knew
he was with this man Hood, and when
I left the table awhile ago I met him
outside the servants&#8217; dining-room and
told him I would talk to him here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he call himself?&#8221; Deering
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Torrence is the name the Drakes
gave him,&#8221; she answered with faint
irony. &#8220;He&#8217;s a ranchman in Wyoming
and was in Bob Drake&#8217;s class in college.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He knew perfectly well that the
Drakes were not people likely to countenance
an impostor. His first instinct
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
had been to protect his sister from an
unknown scamp, and he was sorry that
he had spoken to her so roughly. Her
distress and anxiety were apparent, and
he was filled with pity for her. Since
childhood they had been the best of
pals, and if she loved a man who was
worthy of her he would aid the affair
in every way possible. He was surprised
by the abruptness with which she stepped
close to him and laid her hand on his
arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy, who <i>is</i> Hood?&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; he ejaculated, and
then as she eyed him curiously he explained
hurriedly: &#8220;I was in an awful
mess when he turned up, Connie. I&#8217;d
gone into a copper deal with Ned Ranscomb
and needed more money to help
him through with it. I put in all I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
had and touched one of father&#8217;s boxes
at the bank for some more and lost it,
or didn&#8217;t lose it; God knows what did
become of it! It would take a week to
tell you the whole story. Ranscomb
disappeared, absolutely, and there I was!
I should have killed myself if that lunatic
Hood hadn&#8217;t turned up and hypnotized
me. But what&mdash;what&mdash;&#8221; (he fairly
choked with the question), &#8220;in heaven&#8217;s
name are you doing here? Why did you
cut out California? I tell you, Connie,
if I&#8217;m not crazy everybody else is! I
nearly fainted when you came into the
dining-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Constance smiled at his despair, but
hurried on with explanations:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t talk here, but I can clear
up a few things. Father read that
woman&#8217;s book, and it went to his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
head. Yes,&#8221; she added as Deering
groaned in his helplessness, &#8220;father&#8217;s acting
a good deal like those people in the
drawing-room. He&#8217;s got the May madness,
and I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve got a touch of
it myself! Father started off to have
adventures like the people in that book
and dragged me along to get my mind
off Tommy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tommy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Torrence!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy swallowed this with a gulp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Billy,&#8221; Constance continued
seriously, &#8220;there&#8217;s really something on
father&#8217;s mind; he thinks he&#8217;s looking for
somebody, and I&#8217;m not sure whether he
is or not. That&#8217;s how I come to be
here. He made me answer an advertisement
and take this position to spy on
these people.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; Deering gasped, &#8220;gone
clean mad, the whole bunch of us. Who
the deuce are these lunatics anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Billy; honestly I
don&#8217;t! You know nearly as much about
them as I do. Their mail goes to a
bank in town, and I met my employer
at a lawyer&#8217;s office in Hartford. Father
suspects something and made me do
it, so I might watch them. The mother
and daughter have been abroad a great
deal, and just came home a month ago.
I never saw this man Hood until to-night.
The mother and daughter and
the old gentleman call each other by
the names you heard at the table, and
the books in the library are marked
with half a dozen names. Even the silver
gives no clew. I&#8217;ve been here a
week and only one person has come to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
the house&#8221; (she lowered her voice to a
whisper), &#8220;and that was Ned Ranscomb!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He clutched her hands, and the words
he tried to utter became a queer, inarticulate
gurgle in his throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ned came here to see a girl,&#8221; she
went on: &#8220;an artist who made the pictures
for &#8216;The Madness of May.&#8217; He&#8217;s
quite crazy about her. I did get that
much out of Pierrette. This artist&#8217;s a
victim of the madness too, and seems
to be leading Ned a gay dance!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Took my two hundred thousand and
got me to steal two more,&#8221; he groaned,
&#8220;and then went chasing a girl all over
creation! And the fool always bragged
that he was immune; that no girl&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another victim of the same disease,
that&#8217;s all,&#8221; answered Constance with a
wry smile.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not Ned; not Ranscomb! That
settles it! We&#8217;ve all gone loony!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, even so, we mustn&#8217;t be caught
here,&#8221; said Constance with decision as
the music ceased.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, quick, where can I find the
governor?&#8221; Deering demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you <i>must</i> know, Billy,&#8221; she replied,
her lips quivering with mirth,
&#8220;our dear parent is in jail&mdash;in <i>jail</i>!
Tommy collected those glad tidings at
the garage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Having launched this at her astounded
brother, she pushed him from her and
ran away through the conservatory.

<h2>VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Tuck, my boy, you should cultivate
the art of music!&#8221; cried
Hood as Deering reappeared, somewhat
pale but resigned to an unknown fate,
in the drawing-room. &#8220;And now that
ten has struck we must be on our way.
Madam, will you ring for Cassowary,
the prince of chauffeurs, as we must
leave your hospitable home at once?&#8221;
He began making his adieus with the
greatest formality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Tuck,&#8221; said the mistress of the
house as Deering gave her a limp hand,
&#8220;you have conferred the greatest honor
upon us. Please never pass our door
without stopping.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; he said, turning to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
Pierrette, &#8220;I shall find you to-morrow,
either here or in the Dipper!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you see me or the Dipper
again, many things may happen!&#8221; she
laughed.
</p>
<p>The trio&mdash;the absurd little Pantaloon;
Columbine, laughing and gracious to
the last, and Pierrette, smiling, charming,
adorable&mdash;cheerily called good night
from the door as Cassowary sent the car
hurrying out of the grounds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of the life
of freedom now?&#8221; demanded Hood as
the car reached the open road. &#8220;Begin
to have a little faith in me, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you seemed to put it over,&#8221;
Deering admitted grudgingly. &#8220;But I
can&#8217;t go on this way, Hood; I really
can&#8217;t stand it. I&#8217;ve got to quit right
now!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy!&#8221; Hood protested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard bad news about my
father; one of the&mdash;er&mdash;servants back
there told me he was in jail!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; bawled Hood. &#8220;This is important
if true! Cassowary, I&#8217;ve told
you time and again to bring me any
news you pick up in servants&#8217; halls.
What have you heard about the arrest
of a gentleman named Deering?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been pinched, all right,&#8221; the
chauffeur answered as he stopped the
car and turned round. &#8220;The constables
over at West Dempster are trapping
joy-riders, and they nailed Mr. Deering
about sundown for speeding. I learned
that from the chauffeur at that house
where you dined.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hood slapped his knee and chortled
with delight.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s work ahead of us! But
probably he&#8217;s bailed himself out by this
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life!&#8221; Cassowary answered,
and Deering marked a note of
jubilation in his tone, as though the
thought of Mr. Deering&#8217;s incarceration
gave him pleasure. &#8220;The magistrate&#8217;s
away for the night, and there&#8217;s nobody
there to fix bail. It&#8217;s part of the treatment
in these parts to hold speed fiends
a night or two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Hood&#8217;s hand fell upon Deering&#8217;s
knee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A situation to delight the gods!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;Cassowary, old man, at
the next crossroads turn to the right
and run in at the first gate. There&#8217;s a
farmhouse in the midst of an orchard;
we&#8217;ll stop there and change our clothes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>As the car started Deering whirled
upon Hood and shook him violently by
the collar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick of all this rot! I can&#8217;t
stand any more, I tell you. I&#8217;m going
to quit right here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hood drew his arm round him affectionately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear son, have I failed you at
any point? Have you ever in your life
had any adventures to compare with
those you&#8217;ve had with me? Stop whining
and trust all to Hood!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering sank back into his corner with
a growl of suppressed rage.
</p>
<p>When they reached the farmhouse
Hood drew out a key and opened the
front door with a proprietorial air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose place is this? I want to
know what I&#8217;m getting in for,&#8221; Deering
demanded wrathfully.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mine, dearest Tuck! Mine, and the
taxes paid. I use it as a rest-house for
weary and jaded crooks, if that will
ease your mind!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cassowary struck matches and lighted
candles, disclosing a half-furnished room
in great disorder. Old clothing, paper
bags that had contained food, a violin,
and books in good bindings littered a
table in the middle of the floor, and
articles of clothing were heaped in confusion
on a time-battered settle. The
odor of stale pipe smoke hung upon
the air. Under an empty bottle on the
mantel Hood found a scrap of paper
which he scanned for a moment and
then tore into pieces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a scratch from good old Fogarty;
he&#8217;s been taking the rest-cure here between
jobs. Skipped yesterday; same
chap that left his mark for me on that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
barn. One of the royal good fellows,
Fogarty; does his work neatly&mdash;never
carries a gun or pots a cop; knows he
can climb out of any jail that ever was
made, and that, son, gives any man a
joyful sense of ease and security. The
Tombs might hold him, but he avoids
large cities; knows his limitations like
a true man of genius. Rare bird;
thrifty doesn&#8217;t describe him; he&#8217;s just
plain stingy; sells stolen postage-stamps
at par; the only living yegg that can
put that over! By George, I wouldn&#8217;t
be surprised if he couldn&#8217;t sell &#8217;em at a
premium!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he talked he rummaged among the
old clothes, chose a mud-splashed pair
of trousers, and bade Deering put them
on, adding an even more disreputable
coat and hat. Cassowary helped himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
to a change of raiment, and Hood
selected what seemed to be the worst of
the lot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three suspicious characters will be
noted by the constabulary of West
Dempster within two hours!&#8221; cried
Hood, hopping out of his dress trousers.
&#8220;Into the calaboose we shall go, my
dear Tuck! Never say that I haven&#8217;t
a thought for your peace and happiness.
It will give me joy unfeigned to
bring you face to face with your delightful
parent. Cassowary, my son,
I&#8217;m going to hide those bills of yours
in the lining of my coat for safety. If
they found ten thousand plunks on me,
they&#8217;d never let us go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hood!&#8221; cried Deering in a voice
moist with tears, &#8220;for God&#8217;s sake what
fool thing are you up to now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you we&#8217;re going to jail!&#8221;
Hood answered jubilantly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
dined in good company with the most
charming of girls at your side; you&#8217;ve
had a taste of the prosperous life; and
now it&#8217;s fitting that we should touch
the other extreme. The moment we
step out of this shack we&#8217;re criminals,
crooks, gallows meat;&#8221; he rolled this
last term under his tongue unctuously.
&#8220;This will top all our other adventures.
Here&#8217;s hoping Fogarty may have preceded
us. The old boy likes to get
pinched occasionally just for the fun of
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was already blowing out the
candles, and, seizing his stick, led the
way back to the highway, with Deering
and Cassowary at his heels. The car
had been run into an old barn, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
had evidently served Hood before.
Within twenty-four hours they would
be touring again, he announced. The
change from his dress clothes to ill-fitting
rags had evidently wrought a
change of mood. Between whiffs at
his pipe he sought consolation in Wagner,
chanting bars of &#8220;In <i>fernem</i>
Land.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cassowary, who had adjusted himself
to this new situation without question,
whispered in Deering&#8217;s ear: &#8220;Don&#8217;t kick;
he&#8217;s got something up his sleeve. And
he&#8217;ll get you out of it; remember that!
I&#8217;ve been in jail with him before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deering drew away impatiently. He
was in no humor to welcome confidences
from Torrence, <i>alias</i> Cassowary, whom
his sister met clandestinely and <i>kissed</i>&mdash;the
kiss rankled! And yet it was nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
against Cassowary that he had been
following Hood about like an infatuated
fool. Deering knew himself to be equally
culpable on that score, and he was even
now trudging after the hypnotic vagabond
with a country calaboose as their
common goal. The chauffeur&#8217;s interview
with Constance had evidently cheered
him mightily, and he joined his voice to
Hood&#8217;s in a very fair rendering of &#8220;Ben
Bolt.&#8221; Deering swore under his breath,
angry at Hood, and furious that he had
so little control of a destiny that seemed
urging him on to destruction.
</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
</div>

<p>At one o&#8217;clock West Dempster lay
dark and silent before them. As
they crossed a bridge into the town
Hood began to move cautiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that we give up without
a struggle: there&#8217;s too much at stake
to risk a bullet now, and these country
lumpkins shoot first, and hand you their
cards afterward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He dived into an alley, and emerged
midway of a block where a number of
barrels under a shed awning advertised
a grocery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Admirable!&#8221; whispered Hood, throwing
his arms about his comrades. &#8220;We
will now arouse the watch.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>With this he kicked a barrel into the
gutter, and jumped back like a mischievous
boy into the shelter of the
alley. Footsteps were heard in a moment,
far down the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These country cops are sometimes
shrewd, but often the silly children of
convention like the rest of us. West
Dempster has an evil reputation in the
underworld. The pinching of joy-riders
is purely incidental; they run in anybody
they catch after the curfew sounds
from the coffin factory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A window overhead opened with a
bang, and a blast from a police whistle
pierced the air shrilly. Deering started
to run, but Hood upset him with a thrust
of his foot. Two men were already
creeping up behind them in the alley;
the owner of the grocery stole out of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
the front door in a long nightgown and
began howling dismally for help.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw up your hands, boys; it&#8217;s
no use!&#8221; cried Hood in mock despair.
</p>
<p>Then the man in the nightgown, after
menacing Hood with a pistol, stuck
the barrel of it into Deering&#8217;s mouth,
opened inopportunely to protest his innocence.
The policemen threw themselves
upon Hood and Cassowary,
toppled them over, and flashed electric
lamps in their faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;More o&#8217; them yeggs,&#8221; announced
one of the officers with satisfaction as
he snapped a pair of handcuffs on Cassowary&#8217;s
wrists. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you fellows try
any monkey-shines or we&#8217;ll plug you
full o&#8217; lead. Trot along now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The gentleman in the night-robe
wished to detain the party for a recital
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
of his own prowess in giving warning
of the attempted burglary. The police
were disposed to make light of his assistance,
while Hood hung back to support
the grocer&#8217;s cause, a generosity on
his part that was received ill-temperedly
by the officers of the law. They bade
the grocer report to the magistrate Monday
morning, and they parted, but only
after Hood had shaken the crestfallen
grocer warmly by the hand, warning
him with the greatest solicitude against
further exposure to the night air. Two
other policemen appeared; the whole
force was doing them honor, Hood declared
proudly. He lifted his voice in
song, but the lyrical impulse was hushed
by a prod from a revolver. He continued
to talk, however, assuring his
captors of his heartiest admiration for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
their efficiency. He meant to recommend
them for positions in the secret
service&mdash;men of their genius were wasted
upon a country town.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;Throw up your hands, boys; it&#8217;s no use!&#8221; cried Hood<br />
in mock despair.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>When they reached the town hall a
melancholy jailer roused himself and
conducted them to the lockup in the
rear of the building. Careful search
revealed nothing but a mass of crumpled
clippings and a pipe and tobacco in
Hood&#8217;s pockets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess they dropped their tools somewhere,&#8221;
muttered one of the officers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; explained Hood, &#8220;the
gentleman in the nightie, whom I take
to be a citizen and merchant of standing
in your metropolis, may be able to assist
you in finding them. We left our safe-blowing
apparatus in a chicken-coop in
his back yard.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>They were entered on the blotter as
R. Hood, F. Tuck, and Cass O&#8217;Weary&mdash;the
last Hood spelled with the utmost
care for the scowling turnkey&mdash;and
charged with attempt to commit burglary
and arson.
</p>
<p>Hood grumbled; he had hoped it
would be murder or piracy on the high
seas; burglary and arson were so commonplace,
he remarked with a sigh.
</p>
<p>The door closed upon them with an
echoing clang, and they found themselves
in a large coop, bare save for several
benches ranged along the walls. Two
of these were occupied by prisoners,
one of whom, a short, thick-set man,
snored vociferously. Hood noted his
presence with interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fogarty!&#8221; he whispered with a triumphant
wave of his hand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>A tall man who had chosen a cot as
remote as possible from his fellow prisoner
sat up and, seeing the newcomers,
stalked majestically to the door and
yelled dismally for the keeper, who
lounged indifferently to the cage, puffing
a cigar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an outrage!&#8221; roared the
prisoner. &#8220;Locking me up with these
felons&mdash;these common convicts! I demand
counsel; I&#8217;m going to have a
writ of habeas corpus! When I get out
of here I&#8217;m going to go to the governor
of your damned State and complain of
this. All Connecticut shall know of
it! All America shall hear of it! To
be locked up with one safe-blower is
enough, and now you&#8217;ve stuck three
murderers into this rotten hole. I tell
you I can give bail. I tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>The jailer snarled and bade him be
quiet. In the tone of a man who is
careful of his words he threatened the
direst punishment for any further expression
of the gentleman&#8217;s opinions.
Whereupon the gentleman seized the
bars and shook them violently, and then,
as though satisfied that they were steel
of the best quality, dropped his arms
to his sides with a gesture of impotent
despair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In spite of Constance&#8217;s assertion, confirmed
by Cassowary, Deering had not
believed that his father was in jail;
but the outraged gentleman who had
demanded the writ of habeas corpus
was, beyond question, Samuel J. Deering,
head of the banking-house of Deering,
Gaylord &amp; Co. Mr. Deering was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
striding toward his bench with the sulky
droop of a premium batter who has
struck out with the bases full.
</p>
<p>Scorning to glance at the creature in
rags who had flung himself in his path,
Samuel J. Deering lunged at him fiercely
with his right arm. Billy, ducking opportunely,
saved his indignant parent
from tumbling upon the floor by catching
him in his arms. Feeling that he
had been attacked by a ruffian, Mr.
Deering yelled that he was being murdered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Billy! For God&#8217;s sake, be
quiet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The senior Deering tottered to the wall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy! What are <i>you</i> in for?&#8221; he
demanded finally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Burglary, arson, and little things
like that,&#8221; Billy answered with a jauntiness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
that surprised him as much as it
pained his father, who continued to
stare uncomprehendingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been reading that damned
book, too, have you?&#8221; he whispered
hoarsely in his son&#8217;s ear. &#8220;You&#8217;ve gone
crazy like everybody else, have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been kidnapped, if that&#8217;s what
you mean,&#8221; Billy answered with a meaningful
glance over his shoulder, and then
with a fine attempt at bravado: &#8220;I&#8217;m
Friar Tuck, and that chap smoking a
pipe is Robin Hood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ordinarily his father&#8217;s sense of humor
could be trusted to respond to an intelligent
appeal. A slow grin had overspread
Mr. Deering&#8217;s face as Friar Tuck
was mentioned, but when Billy added
Robin Hood his father&#8217;s countenance
underwent changes indicative of hope,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
fear, and chagrin. Clinging to Billy&#8217;s
shoulder, he peered through the gloom
of the cage toward Hood, who lay on
a bench, his coat rolled up for a pillow,
tranquilly smoking, with his eyes fixed
upon the steel roof.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hood!&#8221; Mr. Deering walked slowly
toward Hood&#8217;s bench.
</p>
<p>Hood sat up, took his pipe from his
mouth, and nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hood, this is my father,&#8221; said Billy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A great pleasure, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; Hood
responded courteously, extending his
hand. &#8220;I suppose it was inevitable that
we should meet sooner or later, Mr.
Deering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you <i>are</i> Bob&mdash;Bob&mdash;Tyringham?&#8221;
asked Deering anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; cried Hood in his usual
assured manner. &#8220;And I will say for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
you that you have given me a good
chase. I confess that I didn&#8217;t think you
capable of it; I swear I didn&#8217;t! Tuck,
I congratulate you; your father is one
of the true brotherhood of the stars.
He&#8217;s been chasing me for a month and,
by Jove, he&#8217;s kept me guessing! But
when I heard that he&#8217;d been jailed for
speeding, with a prospect of spending
Sunday in this hole, I decided that it
was time to throw down the mask.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lights began to dance in the remote
recesses of Billy&#8217;s mind. Hood was
Robert Tyringham, for whom his father
held as trustee two million dollars.
Tyringham had not been heard of in
years. The only son of a most practical
father, he had been from youth a victim
of the <i>wanderlust</i>, absenting himself
from home for long periods. For ten
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
years he had been on the list of the
missing. That Hood should be this
man was unbelievable. But the senior
Deering seemed not to question his
identity. He sat down with a deep sigh
and then began to laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t found you by next
Wednesday, I should have had to turn
your property over to a dozen charitable
institutions provided for by your father&#8217;s
will&mdash;and, by George, I&#8217;ve been fighting
a temptation to steal it!&#8221; His arms
clasped Billy&#8217;s shoulder convulsively.
&#8220;It&#8217;s been horrible, ghastly! I&#8217;ve been
afraid I might find you and afraid I
wouldn&#8217;t! I tell you it&#8217;s been hell.
I&#8217;ve spent thousands of dollars trying
to find you, fearing one day you might
turn up, and the next day afraid you
wouldn&#8217;t. And, you know, Tyringham,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
your father was my dearest friend; that&#8217;s
what made it all so horrible. I want
you to know about it, Billy; I want you
to know the worst about me; I&#8217;m not
the man you thought me. When I
started away with Constance and told
you I was going to California I decided
to make a last effort to find Tyringham.
I read a damned novel that acted on
me like a poison; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve made
a fool of myself in a thousand ways,
thinking that by masquerading over the
country I might catch Tyringham at his
own game. And now you know what I
might have been; you see what I was
trying to be&mdash;a common thief, a betrayer
of a sacred trust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like that, father,&#8221; began
Billy, shaken by his father&#8217;s humility.
&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re in the same hole, only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
I&#8217;m in deeper. I tried to rob <i>you</i>. I
tried to steal some of that Tyringham
money myself, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hood, wishing to leave the two alone
for their further confidences, walked to
the recumbent Fogarty, roused him with
a dig in the ribs, and conferred with
him in low tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You took the stuff from my box,
Billy?&#8221; Mr. Deering asked.
</p>
<p>Billy waited apprehensively for what
might follow. It was possible that his
father had already robbed the Tyringham
estate; the thought chilled him
into dejection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>had</i> stolen it. My God, I couldn&#8217;t
help it!&#8221; Deering groaned. &#8220;I left that
waste paper in the box to fool myself,
and put the real stuff in another place.
I hoped&mdash;yes, that was it, I hoped&mdash;I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
never find Tyringham and I could keep
those bonds. But all the time I kept
looking for him. You see, Billy, I couldn&#8217;t
be as bad as I wanted to be; and
yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew his hand across his face as
though to shut out the picture he saw
of himself as a felon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you wouldn&#8217;t have done it;
you couldn&#8217;t have done it!&#8221; cried Billy,
anxious to mitigate his father&#8217;s misery.
&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t hidden the real bonds, I&#8217;d
have been a thief! Ned Ranscomb was
trying to corner Mizpah and needed my
help. I put in all I had&mdash;that two hundred
thousand you gave me my last
birthday, and then he skipped. When
I get hold of <i>him</i>&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You put two hundred thousand in
Mizpah?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I did, like a fool, and, of course, it&#8217;s
lost! Ned went daffy about a girl and
dropped Mizpah&mdash;and my money!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Deering was once more a business
man. &#8220;What did Ranscomb buy at?&#8221;
he asked curtly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven and a quarter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you needn&#8217;t kick Ned! The
Ranscombs put through their deal and
Mizpah&#8217;s gone to forty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hood rejoined them, and they talked
till daylight. He told them much of
himself. The responsibility of a great
fortune had not appealed to him; he
had been honest in his preference for the
vagabond life, but realized, now that
he was well launched upon middle age,
that it was only becoming and decent
for him to alter his ways. Billy&#8217;s liking
for him, that had struggled so rebelliously
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
against impatience and distrust,
warmed to the heartiest admiration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I knew you were married,&#8221;
the senior Deering remarked for
Billy&#8217;s enlightenment, &#8220;and now and
then I got glimpses of you in your gypsy
life. Your wife had a fortune of her
own&mdash;she was one of Augustus Davis&#8217;s
daughters&mdash;so of course she hasn&#8217;t suffered
from your foolishness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife shared my tastes; there
has never been the slightest trouble
between us. Our daughter is just like
us. But now Mrs. Tyringham thinks
we ought to settle down and be respectable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew your wife and daughter had
come home. I had got that far,&#8221; Mr.
Deering resumed. &#8220;And after I began
to suspect that you and Hood were the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
same person I put my own daughter
into your house on the Dempster road
as a spy to watch for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife wasn&#8217;t fooled for a minute,&#8221;
Hood chuckled. &#8220;We were having our
last fling before we settled down for
the rest of our days. We all have the
same weakness for a springtime lark: my
wife, my daughter, and I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy ran his hands through his hair.
&#8220;Pierrette! Pierrette is your daughter!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied Hood; &#8220;and
Columbine, the dearest woman in the
world, is my wife, and Pantaloon my
father-in-law. In my affair with you
there was only one coincidence: everything
else was planned. It was Pierrette,
whose real name is Roberta&mdash;Bobby
for short, when we&#8217;re not playing
a game of some sort&mdash;Bobby really
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
did lift your suitcase by mistake. And
it was stowed away in Cassowary&#8217;s car
when I came to your house intending
to return it. But when I saw that you
needed diversion I decided to give you
a whirl. It was an easy matter for
Cassowary to move the suitcase to the
bungalow, where you found it. I steered
you to the house on purpose to see how
you and Bobby would hit it off. The
result seems to have been satisfactory!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cassowary turned uneasily on his
bench.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And before we quit all this foolishness,&#8221;
Hood resumed with a glance at
the chauffeur, &#8220;there&#8217;s one thing I want
to ask you, Mr. Deering, as a special
favor. That chap lying over there is
Tommy Torrence, whom you kicked off
your door-step for daring to love your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
daughter. He&#8217;s one of the best fellows
in the world. Just because his father,
the old senator, didn&#8217;t quite hit it off
with you in a railroad deal before Tommy
was born is no reason why you should
take it out on the boy. He started for
the bad after you made a row over his
attentions to your daughter, but he&#8217;s
been with me six months and he&#8217;s as
right and true a chap as ever lived.
You&#8217;ve got to fix it up with him or I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;well,
I&#8217;ll be pretty hard on your
boy if he ever wants to break into my
family!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With this Hood rose and drew from
his pocket a handful of newspaper clippings
which he threw into the air and
watched flutter to the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are some of your advertisements
offering handsome rewards for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
news of me dead or alive. In collecting
them I&#8217;ve had a mighty good time.
Let&#8217;s all go to sleep; to-morrow night
the genial Fogarty will get us out of
this. He&#8217;s over there now sawing the
first bar of that window!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>X</h2>
</div>

<p>A year has passed and it is May
again and the last day of that
month of enchantment. There has been
a house-party at the Deering place at
Radford Hills. Constance came from
Wyoming to spend May with her father,
bringing with her, of course, her husband,
sometime known as Cassowary,
who has been elected to the legislature
of his State and, may, it is reported,
be governor one of these days. The
Tyringhams are there, and this includes
Robert Tyringham, <i>alias</i> R. Hood, and
his wife (whose authorship of &#8220;The
Madness of May,&#8221; has not yet been
acknowledged) and also her father, Augustus
Davis, who continues to find
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
recreation in frequent attacks upon any
inoffensive piano that gets in his way.
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Ranscomb, too,
have shared Mr. Deering&#8217;s hospitality.
Marriage has not interrupted Mrs. Ranscomb&#8217;s
career as an artist, though she
has dropped illustrating, and is specializing
in children&#8217;s portraits with distinguished
success.
</p>
<p>The senior Deering, wholly at peace
with his conscience, does not work as
hard as he used to before his taste of
adventurous life gained in the pursuit of
Hood. He is very proud of his daughter-in-law,
whose brown eyes bring constant
cheer and happiness to his table. If
she does not hang moons in trees any
more, she is still quite capable of doing
so, and has no idea of permitting her
husband to wear himself out in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
banking-house. They are going to keep
some time every year for play, she declares,
to the very end of their lives.
</p>
<p>Hood had been devoting himself assiduously
to mastering the details of
his business affairs, living as other men
do, keeping regular office hours in a
tall building with an outlook toward
the sea, and taking his recreation on
the golf-links every other afternoon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma has been nervous all this
month about papa,&#8221; Roberta (known
otherwise as Pierrette or Bobby) was
saying as she and Billy slowly paced
the veranda. &#8220;But now May is over
and he hasn&#8217;t shown any disposition to
run away. I suppose he&#8217;s really cured.&#8221;
There was a tinge of regret in her last
words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Billy replied carelessly. &#8220;He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
hasn&#8217;t mentioned his old roving days
lately. I think he&#8217;s even sensitive about
having them referred to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But even if he should want to go,
mamma wouldn&#8217;t break her heart about
it. She feels that it&#8217;s really something
fine in him: his love of the out-of-doors,
and adventures, and knowing all sorts
and conditions of men. And he has
really helped lots of people, just as he
helped you. And he always had so
much fun when we all played gypsy,
or he went off alone and came back
with no end of good stories. I&#8217;m just
a little sorry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>They paused, clasping hands and looking
off at the starry canopy. Suddenly
from the side of the house a man
walked slowly, hesitatingly. He stopped,
turned, glanced at the veranda, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
then, sniffing the air, walked rapidly
toward the gate, swinging a stick, his
face lifted to the stars.
</p>
<p>Bobby&#8217;s hand clasped Billy&#8217;s more
tightly as they watched in silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s papa; he&#8217;s taking to the road
again!&#8221; she murmured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;ll come back; it won&#8217;t be
for long this time. I haven&#8217;t the heart
to stop him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;it would be
cruel to do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lamps at the gate shone upon
Robert Tyringham as he paused and
then, with a characteristic flourish of
his stick, turned westward and strode
away into the night.
